In the model, distrust creates public demand for regulation, while regulation in turn discourages social capital accumulation, leading to multiple equilibria. A key implication of the model is that individuals in low trust countries want more government intervention even though the government is corrupt. We test this and other implications of the model using country- and individual-level data on social capital and beliefs about government's role, as well as on changes in beliefs and in trust during the transition from socialism.},

	title = {The Emergence of the {Post-Socialist} Welfare State - The Case of the Baltic States : Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania},
	abstract = {Abstract: This dissertation takes a step towards providing a better understanding of post-socialist welfare state development from a theoretical as well as an empirical perspective. The overall analytical goal of this thesis has been to critically assess the development of social policies in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania using them as illustrative examples of post-socialist welfare state development in the light of the theories, approaches and typologies that have been developed to study affluent capitalist democracies. The four studies included in this dissertation aspire to a common aim in a number of specific {ways.The} first study tries to place the ideal-typical welfare state models of the Baltic States within the well-known welfare state typologies. At the same time, it provides a rich overview of the main social security institutions in the three countries by comparing them with each other and with the previous structures of the Soviet period. It examines the social insurance institutions of the Baltic States (old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, short-term benefits, sickness, maternity and parental insurance and family benefits) with respect to conditions of eligibility, replacement rates, financing and contributions. The findings of this study indicate that the Latvian social security system can generally be labelled as a mix of the basic security and corporatist models. The Estonian social security system can generally also be characterised as a mix of the basic security and corporatist models, even if there are some weak elements of the targeted model in it. It appears that the institutional changes developing in the social security system of Lithuania have led to a combination of the basic security and targeted models of the welfare state. Nevertheless, as the example of the three Baltic States shows, there is diversity in how these countries solve problems within the field of social policy. In studying the social security schemes in detail, some common features were found that could be attributed to all three countries. Therefore, the critical analysis of the main social security institutions of the Baltic States in this study gave strong supporting evidence in favour of identifying the post-socialist regime type that is already gaining acceptance within comparative welfare state {research.Study} Two compares the system of social maintenance and insurance in the Soviet Union, which was in force in the three Baltic countries before their independence, with the currently existing social security systems. The aim of the essay is to highlight the forces that have influenced the transformation of the social policy from its former highly universal, albeit authoritarian, form, to the less universal, social insurance-based systems of present-day Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This study demonstrates that the welfare–economy nexus is not the only important factor in the development of social programs. The results of this analysis revealed that people's attitudes towards distributive justice and the developmental level of civil society also play an important part in shaping social policies. The shift to individualism in people’s mentality and the decline of the labour movement, or, to be more precise, the decline in trade union membership and influence, does nothing to promote the development of social rights in the Baltic countries and hinders the expansion of social policies. The legacy of the past has been another important factor in shaping social programs. It can be concluded that social policy should be studied as if embedded not only in the welfare-economy nexus, but also in the societal, historical and cultural nexus of a given society. Study Three discusses the views of the state elites on family policy within a wider theoretical setting covering family policy and social policy in a broader sense and attempts to expand this analytical framework to include other post-socialist countries. The aim of this essay is to explore the various views of the state elites in the Baltics concerning family policy and, in particular, family benefits as one of the possible explanations for the observed policy differences. The qualitative analyses indicate that the Baltic States differ significantly with regard to the motives behind their family policies. Lithuanian decision-makers seek to reduce poverty among families with children and enhance the parents’ responsibility for bringing up their children. Latvian policy-makers act so as to increase the birth rate and create equal opportunities for children from all families. Estonian policy-makers seek to create equal opportunities for all children and the desire to enhance gender equality is more visible in the case of Estonia in comparison with the other two countries. It is strongly arguable that there is a link between the underlying motives and the kinds of family benefits in a given country. This study, thus, indicates how intimately the attitudes of the state bureaucrats, policy-makers, political elite and researchers shape social policy. It confirms that family policy is a product of the prevailing ideology within a country, while the potential influence of globalisation and Europeanisation is detectable too. The final essay takes into account the opinions of welfare users and examines the performances of the institutionalised family benefits by relying on the recipients’ opinions regarding these benefits. The opinions of the populations as a whole regarding government efforts to help families are compared with those of the welfare users. Various family benefits are evaluated according to the recipients' satisfaction with those benefits as well as the contemporaneous levels of subjective satisfaction with the welfare programs related to the absolute level of expenditure on each program. The findings of this paper indicate that, in Latvia, people experience a lower level of success regarding state-run family insurance institutions, as compared to those in Lithuania and Estonia. This is deemed to be because the cash benefits for families and children in Latvia are, on average, seen as marginally influencing the overall financial situation of the families concerned. In Lithuania and Estonia, the overwhelming majority think that the family benefit systems improve the financial situation of families. It appears that recipients evaluated universal family benefits as less positive than targeted benefits. Some universal benefits negatively influenced the level of general satisfaction with the family benefits system provided in the countries being researched. This study puts forward a discussion about whether universalism is always more legitimate than targeting. In transitional economies, in which resources are highly constrained, some forms of universal benefits could turn out to be very expensive in relative terms, without being seen as useful or legitimate forms of help to families. In sum, by closely examining the different aspects of social policy, this dissertation goes beyond the over-generalisation of Eastern European welfare state development and, instead, takes a more detailed look at what is really going on in these countries through the examples of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In addition, another important contribution made by this study is that it revives ‘western’ theoretical knowledge through ‘eastern’ empirical evidence and provides the opportunity to expand the theoretical framework for post-socialist societies.},

@book{alam_growth_????,
	title = {{GROWTH,} {POVERTY,}
{AND} {INEQUALITY}
Eastern Europe and the
Former Soviet Union},
	abstract = {Five years ago the World Bank report, Making Transition Work for Everyone,
helped focus public attention and debate on the urgent challenge
of reducing poverty and inequality in the countries of Eastern Europe
and Central Asia. The report found that one out of five people survived
on less than \$2.15 a day compared with fewer than one in
twenty-five a decade earlier. The sharp increase in poverty was driven
in large part by the collapse in incomes and the increase in inequality.
The working poor, children, rural households, and specific groups
(such as the Roma in Eastern Europe) were at greatest poverty risk.
Capabilities of the poor were being endangered from falling access to
education, corruption (particularly in public service delivery), nutritional
deficiencies, and communicable diseases. And prospects for
rapid poverty reduction seemed remote.
Much has changed in these countries since then. Growth has
rebounded in the Commonwealth of Independent States {(CIS)} from
the depths of the financial crisis of 1998. This was driven by several
factors, in particular, the boost to the Russian Federation’s competitiveness
provided by a large devaluation, the supply response from
structural reforms that had been undertaken by many of the Region’s
countries, and the income windfall from the large and unexpected
increases in the prices of oil and other energy exports. At the same
time, the process of European Union integration has helped broaden
xiv Growth, Poverty, and Inequality: Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union
markets, lock in domestic reforms, and attract higher investment in
acceding countries. The cessation of war in the western Balkans has
also helped make the economic environment more conducive to
investment and growth.
Growth, Poverty, and Inequality: Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet
Union takes stock of the impact of growth on poverty and inequality
during 1998–2003, provides systematic evidence-based analysis to
understand the different outcomes, and suggests areas for further
action. It is heartening to find that during this period growth has
helped more than 40 million people move out of poverty. This has
been aided by improved income distribution in many countries, especially
in the {CIS.} But poverty and vulnerability still remain a significant
problem. More than 60 million are poor (that is, living on
incomes less than \$2.15 a day), and more than 150 million are vulnerable
(that is, living on incomes between \$2.15 and \$4.30 a day).
Most of them are in the middle-income countries even as the low
income countries have higher rates of poverty. Working families constitute
the largest group among the poor. Many others face deprivations
in access and quality of public services. Regional inequalities,
both between and within countries, are large. The heterogeneity of
countries in the Region suggests a differentiated approach across
countries. But it is obvious that prospects for reducing poverty and
vulnerability—and achieving the Millennium Development Goals—
will be crucially dependent on the ability of countries to accelerate
growth and create well-paying jobs; improve the quality of education,
health care, and public infrastructure; and strengthen social
safety nets. Achieving these will require stepping up efforts to complete
the institutional and policy reform agendas and sustaining them.
This report—the first in a new series of regional studies—is an
important contribution to our thinking about how the World Bank
can work more effectively with clients and partners in the Region to
reduce poverty and vulnerability in a rapidly changing world. Forthcoming
reports on jobs, trade, infrastructure, migration, and demographics
will look at the key economic and social opportunities and
challenges. I hope that these reports will stimulate debate, promote
better understanding, and spur action to bring about prosperity for all.},

The book demonstrates that despite an increase in poverty and inequalities in many Central and Eastern European countries during the last 18 years, the social policy systems have not experienced a radical dismantlement throughout the entire region. The {post-Communist} welfare state still shows more comprehensive solutions to social problems than residual ones. Nevertheless, the deteriorated fiscal capacities of the state in some cases hinder the successful poverty solutions as well as the expansion of the welfare programmes. Yet, the Central and Eastern European region is very diverse regarding the scope and depth of social problems encountered and some countries have implemented more successful policy solutions than other ones. Furthermore, the findings of this volume demonstrate that Central and Eastern European countries are not so dramatically distinct from Western Europe, neither in their social problems encountered, nor in their solutions. Nevertheless, the experience of the socialist regime, the relatively lower wages and lower social benefits as well as the higher share of {GDP} produced in a shadow economy allow the {CEE} countries to group into the distinct {post-Communist} regime.},

	abstract = {For a long time in-work poverty was not associated with European welfare states. Recently, the topic has gained relevance as welfare state retrenchment and internationalcompetition in globalised economies has put increasing pressures on individuals and families. The book provides explanations as to why in-work poverty is high in certaincountries and low in others. Much of the present concern about the working poor has to do with recent changes inlabour market policies in Europe. However, this book is not primarily about low pay. Instead, it questions whether gainful employment is sufficient to earn a living ż both for oneself and for oneżs family members. There are, however, great differences between European countries. This book argues that the incidence and structure of the working poor cannot be understood without a thorough understanding of each country's institutional context. This includes the system of wage-setting, the level of decommodification provided by the social security system and the structure of families and households. Combining cross-country studies with in-depth analyses from a national perspective, the book reveals that in-work poverty in Europe is a diverse, multi-faceted phenomenon occurring in equally diverse institutional, economic and socio-demographic settings. With its rich detail and conclusions, this genuinely comparative study will be of interest to academics and researchers of labour and welfare economics, social policy and European studies as well as to policy advisors.},

Before introducing major categories in general and comparative welfare state theory, the meaning of comparative analysis for the future of social welfare will be pointed out briefly. The main part of the paper then addresses new developments in comparative welfare state theory. First, it takes on the importance of using ideal-typical models, and then the issue of the influence of cultural and political determinants on social welfare politics, distinguishing first order and second order determinants. The last part of the paper will sum up the current and future role of comparative social policy analysis for the advance the understanding of and solutions to social problems that today increasingly cut across national boundaries and are increasingly found to impede people's welfare on a world's scale. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

The article argues that Eastern Central European welfare state systems have returned to their historical and cultural roots of welfare state formation and development, to the time before the onset of state socialism in Soviet times. First, social security policies and social and labour laws were established when the vast bulk of Eastern Central European countries were member states of the {Austro-Hungarian} Empire, sharing the same political economy, legal system and culture. Over the last 20 years, the socialist system of employment-based social services and benefits has been replaced with Bismarckian-type social security policy and systems. While there are major alterations here and there 2013 in ideal-typical perspective 2013 the four countries under scrutiny share all the major traits of Continental European {(Christian} Democratic) welfare regimes.},

In particular, the book examines the period after the Second World War and looks in detail at the state developed by the bourgeoisie in welfare policies. By casting its net across five nations and a whole century, the book attempts to establish a broad logic of interest behind the welfare state based on a very extensive range of archival material.},

Strategic reform directions thus followed from the nature of the transition process and from constraints imposed by {EU} accession. Secondly, successful accession is not the end of the story: economic and social trends over the past 50 years are creating strains for social policy which all countries - old and new members - will have to face.},

The {U.S.} states provide clear evidence of convergence, but the findings can be reconciled quantitatively with the neoclassical model only if diminishing returns to capital set in very slowly. The results for per capita gross domestic product from a broad sample of countries are similar if we hold constant a set of variables that proxy for differences in steady-state characteristics.},

Although their work is insightful, most institutionalist scholars tend to relegate policy ideas to the back of their theoretical constructions dealing with welfare state development. The objective of this paper is to show how institutionalist scholarship can pay greater attention to ideational processes without abandoning its core assumptions about the structuring impact of political institutions and policy legacies on welfare state development. If institutions truly influence policy-making, policy ideas matter in and beyond the agenda-setting process. Related to existing policy legacies, perceived problems mesh with policy alternatives grounded in a specific paradigm. When stressing the need to reform, and promoting new alternatives, policy entrepreneurs draw on existing ideological repertoires to frame these alternatives. The ability to successfully frame policy alternatives can become a decisive aspect of the policy process. A discussion of recent European and North American policy debates illustrates these claims.},

There are geographical and political interpretations of the term. {"Eastern} Europe," the territory east from the river Elbe, is first of all a historical category, for the region has evolved over thousands of years. Eastern Europe was already displaying specific traits as early as the very beginning of medieval European development in the 5th to 8th centuries. After the discovery of America and the emerging Atlantic trade, Eastern Europe was left on the "periphery" of the modern world system, lagging behind Western Europe until the 18th century. The "double revolution" of the late 18th century--the Industrial Revolution in England and the socio-political revolution in France--posed many challenges to Eastern Europe. The region met these challenges with a series of reforms based on an imitative strategy of catchup. In the aftermath of World War I, Eastern Europe developed new patterns of reactions, prompted by backwardness and its belated start, by the hindrances and problems of economic, social, and national development, by the presence of numerous and only partly assimilated national-religious minorities. As a result of power relations within the world system, however, a specifically East European socialist model came to fruition following World War {II.} Political Eastern Europe became almost identical with historical Eastern Europe.},

Chinese class stratification has transformed from a rigid status hierarchy under Mao to an open, evolving class system in the {post-Mao} period. Socioeconomic inequalities have also been altered. State redistributive inequalities are giving way to patterns increasingly generated by how individuals and groups succeed in a growing market-oriented economy; rigorous empirical studies have been conducted on occupational prestige, income distribution, housing and consumption, and gender inequality. Finally, occupational mobility, a rare opportunity under Mao, is becoming a living experience for many Chinese in light of emerging labor markets. Scholarly works on status attainment, career mobility, and employment processes show both stability and change in the once politicized social mobility regime. There is relatively richer research output on urban than on rural China, despite the greater and more profound transformations that occurred in rural China. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	isbn = {0198293992, 9780198293996},
	abstract = {Transition in Central and Eastern Europe, as Blanchard points out, has adhered to a U-shaped response in terms of economic output--that is, a sharp decline in output followed by a recovery. Today, most of the countries of Central Europe seem to have enjoyed a steady upswing, while most Eastern European nations still appear to be near the bottom of the U. This book traces the courses, causes, and implications of this pattern, arguing that two basic mechanisms dominate such transition. The first is the reallocation between the state and private sectors, with a contraction of activities in the former and an expansion in the latter. The second is the restructuring of the old state sector, with the opportunity for large improvements in productivity.

Against this background, the book's focus shifts to three particular factors: the adjustment of employment and wages in state firms to the initial shock of reduced demand for their goods; the dynamics of restructuring and privatization; and the relationship between reallocation, restructuring, and traffic in the labor market. The final section summarizes the discussion, and in doing so builds a general equilibrium model as a preliminary to the analysis of three sets of issues: the role of unemployment benefits and privatization `ules; the interaction between transition and fiscal policy; and the evolution of the support for reform. The model is then used to address the thorny issue of the ideal speed for economic reform.

The latest offering from a distinguished expert on the economics of transition, this is one of the first book-length analyses of the process of moving from a centrally-planned to a market economy.},

The dependent variables are public support for the sick and the old as well as for the unemployed as target beneficiaries of welfare state policies. Data from the {ISSP} study Role of Government' are analysed using a multi-level regression technique. Findings indicate that the National level is important in shaping public attitudes toward welfare state policies in industrialized nations, and that both situational and ideological factors play a role. Apparently, various nations generate different public beliefs about national social problems and about the relationship between individuals, the state and other institutions. Eventually, these understandings and beliefs influence popular attitudes regarding what kind of policies the state should pursue, and who should benefit.},

Unlike the coordination dynamic of the competitive assimilation game, the strategic nonassimilation game highlights the strategic interaction between Russian and Latvian players. Russian parents do not look to other Russian parents when deciding to send their children to Latvian schools; rather, they look to Latvian children. They anticipate whether their children will be accepted or excluded in the Latvian classroom. My chief empirical finding is a significant interactive relationship between the size of Russian population and the strength of Latvian nationalism. In regions with small Russian populations, Latvian nationalism fuels assimilation. In regions with large Russian populations, Latvian nationalism propels nonassimilation.},

pattern of transnational production relocation to the postcommunist economies of Eastern Europe. We argue that the collapse
of the socialist heavy industries and the eastward relocation of traditional light industries initially forced the social
conditions of the East European countries to converge at the bottom and deepened the gap between the West and the East. Later,
the east-ward migration of high-skilled labor and capital-intensive industries and jobs led to decreasing social disparity
between the West and some of the former socialist countries. However, convergence appears uncertain, costly, and uneven, and
coincides with increasing social disparity within the group of East European new members and candidates of the European Union.},

	abstract = {Contemporary class analysis takes the national state as its unit of analysis. This convention could be challenged on at least two grounds. On the one hand, the national state might be seen as too gross an aggregation that leads to the neglect of important internal variation; on the other, the national state might be considered an irrelevant distinction for the study of processes that are best viewed on a larger canvas. In this paper we concern ourselves with this latter possibility and we assess the extent to which globalisation threatens to displace the national state's role in shaping class structure and patterns of social fluidity. In our formulation, the competing claims of national state and global system effects on class structures and mobility regimes involve matters of degree, and thus are open to empirical investigation. The existing evidence supports the continued resilience of the national state but not so emphatically as to preclude the need to take account of world-system influences. This leads us to propose an analytical strategy for integrating world-system effects into class analysis. We conclude by suggesting that a more robust challenge to the role of the national state in class analysis might yet come from the growth of the `new regionalism' in Europe and elsewhere.},

While a number of studies have exploited this type of data to distinguish transitory from more chronic forms of income or expenditure poverty, this paper develops an asset-based approach to poverty analysis that makes it possible to distinguish deep-rooted, persistent structural poverty from poverty that passes naturally with time due to systemic growth processes. Drawing on the economic theory of poverty traps and bifurcated accumulation strategies, this paper briefly discusses some feasible estimation strategies for empirically identifying poverty traps and long term, persistent structural poverty. We also propose an extension of the {Foster-Greer} Thorbecke class of poverty measures to provide a natural measure of long-term welfare status. The paper closes with reflections on how asset-based poverty can be used to underwrite the design of persistent poverty reduction strategies.},

It starts by providing a brief description of their main characteristics and continues by offering some empirical evidence specifically tailored to the {CEE} case. It adopts a mechanisms-based explanation approach. Here, the analysis is focused not merely on the identification of correlations existent between variables, but rather on the mechanisms and the causal chains that influencing the actions of actors lead to a determined outcome. The relational character of institutional change will be emphasized here. In fact, not only existing welfare institutions are altered during the process of institutional change, but also the existing institutional relations and organizational features of the welfare state. In the discussion, it will be argued that several mechanisms of institutional change, complementary to each other, have influenced the transformation in three different, but interconnected domains. In the domain of ideas, these mechanisms have taken the form of ideational, communicative and coordinative mechanisms, in the domain of institutions of transformative adaptive mechanisms and, finally, in the domain of interests of increasing returns mechanisms. Four specific mechanisms-based explanation models of institutional change (dissonance-driven desire formation, rational imitation, vacancy chain, and self-fulfilling prophecy) are portrayed, as well as the aggregating characteristics of recombinant transformation (bricolage), as a key mechanism of institutional change in welfare state restructuring, are discussed.},

The main conclusion is that the Russian welfare state will be able to function properly and to ensure social integration and solidarity only under conditions of sustained oil-led growth. The article also identifies a variety of different, but equally important, endogenous, as well as exogenous, factors that have influenced the social policy developments in the Russian Federation since 1989. These correspond to the existence of few veto points present in the political arena, the lack of a well-structured system of interest representation, the presence of informality in the welfare state organization, but also to the presence of national economic vulnerabilities and/or strengths in the now open global economy, as well as to non-contingent decisions taken in strategic sectors of the state, such as those related to the energy or defence sectors.},

It asks what has been the impact of the oil-led economic growth, that has characterized the Russian Federation in recent years, but also what are the negative repercussions of the global financial crisis for the human security of citizens. The key argument put forward in this article is that an asymmetrical development in human security has taken place during the first two decades of transition. The oil-led economic boom did improve the human security of citizens in some specific dimensions directly linked to the economic performance of the country, but not in others where the state-centric approach to modernization has often resulted in a loss of individual security and liberties. If compared to the communist period, the overall human security situation of the country has increased, but substantial progress still has to be done, especially if the possible disruptive consequences of the global financial crisis are fully taken into account.},

Using the concept of embedded democracy developed by Wolfgang Merkel and the members of the project on Defective Democracies, this paper argues that Central and Eastern European societies should be defined as semi-consolidated democracies, since one of the three rings of external embeddedness (the ring concerning the social and economic requisites of democracy) still shows significant deficiencies. The main argument is that due to the presence of shortcomings in the socio-economic environment, the process of democratic stabilization in the region is still far from finished. This is primarily reflected in the attitudes of Eastern European citizens towards non-democratic forms of government. Due to the important democratizing role of welfare institutions, this paper also proposes the inclusion of welfare state efficiency as a key element in the measurement of democratic consolidation.},

The main argument is that the four Visegrad countries have built their contemporary welfare state on the ruins and with the ruins of the welfare state they had previously introduced, and that these welfare states are facing a process of internal restructuring that leads to a hybridization of the system. The paper also identifies four main welfare reform trajectories occurring since World War {II} corresponding to four distinct politics of social security reforms: the politics of expansion for legitimization implemented during the communist period of transformation, followed by the politics of expansion for compensation, politics of retrenchment through privatization and politics of recalibration in the post-communist transitions.},

	abstract = {1. Income inequality has widened in more than three-quarters of {OECD} countries over the past
two decades {(OECD} 2008). This widening of the income distribution happened over a period of sustained
economic growth, the indicator by which progress is commonly measured. Can real progress be achieved
when inequality is increasing? Should we thus revise our concept of progress to take account of the fact
that the benefits of economic growth were not distributed evenly? One could argue that a revision is not
necessary, as long as the citizen of the countries concerned do not see increased inequality as a problem. If,
however, growing inequality affects people’s happiness and we accept that happiness should be an
important component of any concept of progress, inequality must be taken into account.
2. This paper considers in more detail the relationship between actual inequality, desired inequality
and overall social well-being, focussing on the evidence from {OECD} countries over the past two decades.
It first summarises the overall results from the {OECD’s} recent publication Growing Unequal? in terms of
recent levels and changes of inequality. It considers the relationships between actual income inequality and
perceptions about whether it is too high or too low. Finally, it examines the literature on the implications of
income inequality for a global measure of well-being, represented by self-assessed life satisfaction or
happiness.
3. The paper shows that income inequality seems to be considered differently in each country and
thus has varying impacts on well-being. The impact not only depends on country contexts but also on the
actual roots and perceived beliefs about what causes inequality1.},

The decomposition results show that the wage structure effects such as the widened gender pay gap, the increasing return to college education, and the widened gap in the return to different industries, ownership, and regions, have contributed to most of the overall increases in income inequality. During the different time periods, 1987-1996 and 1996-2004, the impacts of these factors vary at the different points (e.g. the lower half or upper half) of distribution.},

	abstract = {Building on the social science literature, we hypothesized that population health indicators in wealthy industrialized countries are [`]clustered' around welfare state regime types. We tested this hypothesis during a period of welfare state expansion from 1960 to 1994. We categorized data from 19 wealthy countries into 4 different types of welfare state regimes {(Social} Democratic, Christian Democratic, Liberal and Wage Earner Welfare States). Outcome variables were the infant mortality rate {(IMR)} and the low birth weight rate {(LBW),} obtained from the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development {(OECD)} Health Data 2000 and from the United Nations Common Statistical Database {(UNCSD).} A two-level multilevel model was constructed, and fixed effects of welfare state were tested. Through the 39 years analyzed, Social Democratic countries exhibited a significantly better population health status, i.e., lower infant mortality rate and low birth weight rate, compared to other countries. Twenty percent of the difference in infant mortality rate among countries could be explained by the type of welfare state, and about 10\% for low birth weight rate. The gap between Social Democracies and other countries widened over the 1990s. Our results confirm that countries exhibit distinctive levels of population health by welfare regime types even when adjusted by the level of economic development {(GDP} per capita) and intra-country correlations. It implies that countries, as groups, adopt similar policies or through any other ways, achieve similar level of health status. Proposed mechanisms of such process and suggestions for future research directions are presented in the discussion.},

Over the past decades, social policy scholars have devoted tremendous efforts to analyze those factors that account for crossnational variation and energize the reform trajectories of advanced welfare states. By contrast, the dependent variable has received much less attention: This volume presents a systematic overview of the dependent variable problem incomparative welfare state research. By sketching different approaches on how to conceptualize and measure social policy change and by highlighting their genuine strengths and weaknesses, this volume should be on the bookshelf of everyone interested in comparative social policy research.?? Stephan Leibfried, University of Bremen, {GermanyContemporary} accounts of welfare state change have produced conflicting findings and incompatible theoretical explanations. To a large extent this is due to a `dependent variable problem? within comparative research, whereby there is insufficient consideration of how to conceptualize, operationalize and measure change. With contributions from leading international scholars, this important book presents a comprehensive examination of conventional indicators (such as social spending), available alternatives (including social rights and conditionality), as well as principal concepts of how to capture change (for example convergence and {efamilization).By} providing an in-depth discussion of the most salient aspects of the `dependent variable problem?, the editors aim to enable a more cumulative build-up of empirical evidence and contribute to constructive theoretical debates about the causes of welfare state change. The volume also offers valuable suggestions as to how the problem might be tackled within empirical crossnational analyses of modern welfare states. The focus on the methodology of conceptualizing and measuring welfare state change in a comparative perspective gives this unique book widespread appeal amongst scholars and researchers of social policy and sociology, as well asstudents at both the advanced undergraduate and post-graduate level studying comparative social policy, research methods and welfare reform.},

Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank,

comparisons outweigh static ones. Internal benchmarks are
more important than external reference groups. However,
local comparisons (to parents, former colleagues or school
classmates) do exert an effect on life satisfaction: they
are more powerful than general comparisons such as my rank
in the social ladder and its evolution. The most important
impact comes from the deterioration of my living standard
and from under-performing my former schoolmates or
colleagues. A possible interpretation is that comparisons
benchmarks are all the more powerful as they are interpreted
by people in terms of seized or lost opportunities.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the pivotal role of social stratification in Russia's health crisis. The primary level causal factor is increased mortality from heart disease and alcohol-related poisonings and accidents. In order to understand the origin of the primary causes, it is necessary to look further for secondary level factors. Whereas policy and stress are important, the leading secondary determinant is negative health lifestyles. The question then arises: What is the source of this lifestyle? This question necessitates a search for tertiary level causes and the absence of a strong middle class in Russia is identified. In Western society, the middle class, especially the upper middle class, is the social carrier of positive health lifestyles across class boundaries. The Russian middle class has not initiated positive health lifestyles countering the predominately negative health lifestyle practices because a middle class similar to that in the West does not exist. Russia needs a civil society in which a similarly stable and empowered middle class can promote positive health lifestyles within its own stratum and elsewhere in the class structure; until this happens, the health situation in that country may not stabilise for the better.},

This study looks at citizens’ definitions of good citizenship in Poland, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, using 2002 European Social Survey data. We investigate mean levels of civic mindedness in these countries and perform regression analyses to investigate whether factors traditionally associated with civic and political participation are also correlated with citizenship norms across Eastern Europe. We show that mean levels of civic mindedness differ significantly across the four Eastern European countries. We find some support for theories on civic and political participation when explaining norms of citizenship, but also demonstrate that individual-level characteristics are differently related to citizenship norms across the countries of our study. Hence, our findings show that Eastern Europe is not a monolithic and homogeneous bloc, underscoring the importance of taking the specificities of countries into account.},

	abstract = {In the early 1990s, the countries of the former Soviet Bloc faced an urgent need to reform the systems by which they delivered broad, basic social welfare to their citizens. Inherited systems were inefficient and financially unsustainable. Linda J. Cook here explores the politics and policy of social welfare from 1990 to 2004 in the Russian Federation, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Most of these countries, she shows, tried to institute reforms based on a liberal paradigm of reduced entitlements and subsidies, means-testing, and privatization. But these proposals provoked opposition from pro-welfare interests, and the politics of negotiating change varied substantially from one political arena to another. In Russia, for example, liberalizing reform was blocked for a decade. Only as Vladimir Putin rose to power did the country change its inherited welfare {system.Cook} finds that the impact of economic pressures on welfare was strongly mediated by domestic political factors, including the level of democratization and balance of pro- and anti-reform political forces. Postcommunist welfare politics throughout Russia and Eastern Europe, she shows, are marked by the large role played by bureaucratic welfare stakeholders who were left over from the communist period and, in weak states, by the development of informal processes in social sectors.},

Most governments initiated reform projects based on a liberal paradigm of reduced entitlements and social sector privatization, moving welfare away from the state toward the market. Yet the patterns of reform diverged in puzzling ways, producing distinct trajectories of change and outcomes. Case studies of three postcommunist states show that the political influence of societal and state-based welfare stakeholders was a key factor in welfare state change. Where political institutions gave stakeholders access, they moderated reforms during recession and sustained a predominant state role in welfare after economic recovery. Where stakeholders were weak, reformist executives retrenched and restructured with little constraint.},

High demand for government regulation and increased state intervention coexists with a low level of trust in government institutions and recognition of high and rising levels of corruption. The findings are consistent with the theory developed by Aghion et al. (2009). In an environment with poor social capital, private business imposes negative externalities on the society and society chooses to demand more state regulation and tolerate corruption in order to reduce these externalities. We also find that individual perceptions of social capital and corruption co-vary with the demand for regulation, as predicted by the theory.},

In particular, we mainly employ Theils'population-weighted index because of its appealing properties. Two decomposition analysis are applied. First, regional inequalities are decomposed by regional subgroups (countries). Second, intertemporal inequality changes are separated into income and population changes. The main results can be summarized as follows. First, data confirm a reduction in crossregional inequality during 1982-97. Second, this reduction is basically due to real convergence among countries. Third, currently the greater part of European interregional disparities is within-country by nature, which introduce an important challenge for the European policy. Fourth, inequality changes are due mainly to income variations, population changes playing a minor role.},

	title = {Can Path Dependence Explain Institutional Change? Two Approaches Applied to Welfare State Reform},
	abstract = {Path dependence as a concept in institutional theories has become increasingly popu-
lar in economics and other social sciences. The key idea is that in a sequence of events,
the latter events are not (completely) independent from those that occurred in the
past. Yet, common usage of the concept often subsumes two markedly different mod-
els and approaches to understand historical sequencing. The two main processes of
the past shaping the future – diffusion and developmental pathways – must be distin-
guished analytically. This paper juxtaposes (1) the unplanned “trodden path” that
takes shape through the subsequent repeated use by other individuals of that sponta-
neously chosen path, and (2) the “branching pathways” or juncture at which one of
the available alternative pathways must be chosen in order to continue a journey. Fur-
thermore, the typical approaches and their explanatory purchase are discussed in ref-
erence to explanations of institutional change. The paper shows that the first path
dependence theorem is too deterministic and inflexible, whereas the second approach
is sufficiently supple to analyze various forms of institutional change.},

Nevertheless, just over 84 million persons, or 17 \% of the {EU-27's} population were at-risk-of-poverty in 2007, while a similar proportion (17 \%) of the total {EU-27} population suffered from material deprivation.

There was a clear overlap between those who were at-risk-poverty and those suffering from, among others, being unable to face unexpected expenses, afford a holiday, keep their home adequately warm, or being able to afford a car. {'Combating} poverty and social exclusion: A statistical portrait of the European Union 2010' presents a broad range of statistical concepts and indicators from social statistics.

For the {EU} countries, information on individual income has been collected until now by the European Community Household Panel survey, which only yields reliable estimates for very large regions within countries. In order to obtain reliable estimates for some of the poverty indicators suggested by the Laeken Council at the sub-national level, we suggest the adoption of a multivariate small area estimation approach which enables us to reduce estimate variability. We concentrate on Italy, the country with the lowest degree of regional cohesion within the {EU.} Results show that disparity cannot be reduced to the so-called {NorthSouth} divide, with the poor South separated from the affluent North, as both these macro-regions display large internal differences in terms of both poverty level and income inequality. The strategy we propose could also be adopted in order to measure poverty in other European regions, using information produced by the new {EU} Survey on Income and Living Conditions, which is replacing the European Community Household Panel.},

	abstract = {Low-income households spend a substantial share of their income on utility services such as electricity, heating and water. The difficulty of these socially vulnerable consumers to absorb further price increases is often used as an argument against tariff reform. However, detailed quantitative information on the affordability of tariff adjustments for low-income consumers is actually quite scarce. Much of the available information is based on households. This paper takes a more detailed look at the affordability of electricity, district heating and water for low-income consumers in transition countries. While the available data are incomplete, the paper finds that affordability is a problem for low-income consumers in most countries, in particular in the water sector and in the Commonwealth of Independent States {(CIS).} The affordability consequences of tariff reform ultimately depend on the speed of tariff adjustments relative to the growth in household income, the level of tariffs needed for cost recovery, the level of effective tariffs at the outset (tariffs adjusted for non-payment) and the demand response to the tariff increase. The paper finds that delaying tariff reform by a few years makes little difference to affordability constraints, and may therefore not be an effective way to mitigate the social impact of utility reform.},

For instance, the {ILO} and the {EU} influenced labour market issues, while family policy was mostly shaped by home-bred ideologies, and to some extent the World Bank. Pension reform was fully steered by the World Bank. The {EU} had an important role in shaping social and civil dialogue. As the monitoring reports following the progress of the candidate countries show, the concerns of the {EU} remained economic and political. The reports approved the moves towards the neo-liberal model inspired by the monetarist agencies. This paper argues that the European impact in the social sphere has strengthened over recent years, and its main payoff is the growing interest and commitment of politics towards poverty and inclusion, and the widening practice of civil and social dialogue.},

historians will characterize trends and developments in European political economies

answer. First, they will point to the slow, halting, and inconclusive process of Euro-
pean integration and the concomitant de-nationalization (more de facto than de lege)
of policy making in European states, a process which arguably amounts to a secular
loss of what has been called "state capacity". Second, they will probably also point to
the rapid, dramatic, and largely unanticipatd demise of state socialism in all European
member states of the Soviet empire, the end of the Cold War, democratic transitions
and (largely) consolidations, and the emergence of five new states (excluding an at
least equal number of the new-born {post-Yugoslav} states - and protectorates! - in the
Western Balkans).},

This paper explores the redistributive effects of different tax benefit instruments in the enlarged {EU} based on two approaches. Inequality analysis based on the standard approach suggests that benefits are the most important factor reducing inequality in the majority of countries. The factor source decomposition approach, however, suggests that benefits play a negligible role and sometimes even contribute slightly positive to inequality. On the contrary, here taxes and social contributions are by far the most important contributors to income inequality reduction. We explain these partly contradictory results with the different normative focus of the two approaches and show that benefits have other aims than redistribution. Finally, our country clustering shows that the Eastern European countries do not form a distinguished group. The Central Eastern European countries group together with the Continental European countries and the Baltic States show similarities with some Southern European countries.},

In particular, it discusses how alternative measures of poverty in an enlarged Europe could take into account both income and non-income aspects and the extent to which comparative measures of consistent poverty reflect country-specific versus European-wide thresholds. These measures are analysed and applied to survey data from the former {EU-15} and three new {EU} member states – the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. The socio-demographic poverty profiles identified in Central Eastern European countries are similar to those of other {EU} member states, with the exception of a relatively lower relative poverty risk for youth in the new {EU} countries. On the other hand, unemployment constitutes the strongest risk factor for falling into poverty, be it defined as monetary, non-monetary or consistent poverty, equally in older and new {EU} countries. The empirical findings indicate important methodological and data requirements and may hence provide a starting point for refining the conceptual and methodological framework for poverty assessment in the enlarged European Union .},

The experiences of the two countries are widely viewed as having been polar opposites. While the Soviet collapse had adverse consequences for many parts of the {post-Soviet} population, the Chinese experience produced a continuing rise of average living standards. Nevertheless, both countries experienced a drastic increase in economic inequality. In both cases, regional inequalities rose more sharply than inequalities across sectors but within regions. In particular, major urban centers gained dramatically relative to the hinterlands. Also, in Russia as in China, those sectors exercising the largest degrees of monopoly power gained the most (or lost the least) in relative terms. In both countries, the respective position of finance improved greatly, while that of agriculture declined. The decline of agriculture in China, however, was not as precipitous as in Russia, and certain sectors, such as education and science, maintained their position in China in a way that was not possible for them in Russia.},

and surveys of firms and households. Examples of the former include the corruption
ratings provided by Political Risk Services for its International Country Risk Guide {(ICRG)}
and by Freedom House in its annual study of Nations in Transit {(NIT).} Examples of the
latter, which generally but not exclusively focus on actual corruption experiences, include
various surveys conducted by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development {(EBRD)—of} which more below—and {theWorld} Economic Forum’s {(WEF)}
Executive Opinion Survey. Two widely used corruption indicators aggregate information
from multiple data sources in both categories: Transparency International’s {(TI)} Corruption
Perceptions Index and the World Bank Institute’s {(WBI)} Control of Corruption Index.
Most cross-national empirical work on corruption uses some combination of expert ratings
and the composite indicators provided by {TI} and {WBI,} and the corresponding rankings of
corruption levels often figure in public discussion of particular countries. The emphasis
on expert assessments is a natural consequence of the relative infrequency and restricted
geographic focus of many firm and household surveys. This limited coverage, in turn, implies
that the composite indicators lean heavily on expert assessments to provide annual ratings
of corruption in a large number of countries.
To what extent do expert assessments of corruption levels correspond to actual corruption
experiences? What do the country-level assessments miss? In this memo, I discuss the
relationship between expert ratings and the picture provided by firm and household surveys.},

	abstract = {This collaborative study has the ambitious goal of providing a new interpretation and analysis of European social policy since the {»Eastern«} enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007. It covers six countries, three of which – France, Germany, and Denmark – represent the older Western European democracies, while the other three are former communist states, namely Poland, Czech Republic, and Estonia.

The authors, all recognised experts in the field, conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of the welfare state – social security, health care, education, public assistance programs, and related social services – in these countries. As a result, the book stands out from other publications of this type.

Also in contrast to other studies, which are usually much more narrowly focused thematically, it highlights demographic trends, poverty levels, patterns of inequality, and labor market policies. This crucial contextual information enables the reader to better understand the challenges and opportunities characterising various
social policy reforms undertaken in European countries in recent years.

There are several important reasons why this book might be regarded as a pioneering work, opening up a new type of discourse among scholars and experts specialising in the European welfare state. First and foremost, two of its editors are leading scholars from Poland, and it offers a fresh perspective on the European Social Model that is not restricted in geographical scope to the established Western democracies.

The country selection is especially noteworthy because it gives the reader a good insight into the diversity and complexity of contemporary welfare states in the wider, enlarged Europe. While Germany and France showcase the difficulties of reforming old and relatively generous Bismarckian welfare states, Poland stands out both as the largest postcommunist democracy and in terms of its efforts to sustain a similar institutional model but at a much lower level of economic development. It is struggling with significant challenges arising from unfinished health care reform, a huge pension burden, new types of structural poverty, and unemployment. The Czech Republic furnishes a relatively successful example of an egalitarian welfare state with residual social democratic traditions, now tempered by neoliberal reform pressures in a postcommunist context.

Finally, Denmark and Estonia represent contrasting cases of small European countries with many similar goals, especially in the development of modern and comprehensive family policies, but also with distinct historical legacies and vast differences in terms of economic resources and contemporary ideological preferences concerning the realization of these goals.},

people face the same level of market development and economic inequality, as well as the
same historically inherited politico-economic culture. Democratic rights increase popular
support for the market. This is true, in particular, of inequality-averse agents, provided that
they trust political institutions. Our findings suggest that one solution to the recent electoral

Using data from the World Values Survey and other sources, we study various explanations of this phenomenon. First, we document that the disparity in life satisfaction between residents of transition and nontransition countries is much larger among the elderly. Second, we find that deterioration in public goods provision, an increase in macroeconomic volatility, and a mismatch of human capital of residents educated before transition (which disproportionately affects the aged population) explain a great deal of the difference in life satisfaction between transition countries and other countries with similar income and other macroeconomic conditions. The rest of the gap is explained by the difference in the quality of the samples. As in other countries, life satisfaction in transition countries is strongly related to income; but, due to a higher nonresponse of high-income individuals in transition countries, the survey-data estimates of the recent increase in life satisfaction, driven by 10-year sustained economic growth in transition region, are biased downwards. The evidence suggests that if the region keeps growing, life satisfaction in transition countries will catch up with the "normal" level in the near future.},

A closer look at the transformation processes of welfare policies in Central and Eastern Europe shows a great variability among those countries in approximating their welfare states to Western European standards. In the design of their pension systems, their health care provision and their unemployment protection, Central and Eastern European Countries {(CEEC)} follow different reform paths. Welfare clusters in Western Europe are used as reference models, but no single example applies to all sectors of social security. Thus, a generalizing picture of welfare provision cannot be drawn for Central and Eastern Europe. Instead of constituting a new individual type of welfare arrangement, a hybridization process is observable.},

The sixteen chapters cover the measurement of poverty and poverty lines, how to create poverty profiles, the comparison of poverty over time and across countries, vulnerability to poverty, monitoring and evaluation of poverty, and the effects of public policy on inequality and poverty. This book will serve as a very useful function in introducing newcomers to poverty analysis and to the entire range of analytical issues that they will be exposed to.

	abstract = {Market transitions are thought to inevitably produce spiraling inequality on the road to economic growth. This review provides an overview of research evaluating inequality in income and wages in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989. The empirical studies agree that inequality has increased, but disagree about the amount, pace, source, and explanation of change. Patterns of inequality are unrelated to economic performance, to the pace or timing of reform, or to rates of subsequent growth. Inequality increased the most in the least successful countries and the least in those countries with historic cultural connections to the West. Inequalities by age, education, region of the country, and health status increased; differences by gender appear to have declined. Although data are plentiful and promising, it is not yet possible to conclude that patterns of inequality among postcommunist countries are due to the genesis of capitalism, to social and cultural assimilation to the West, to adaptations of redistributive institutions to deal with poverty and unemployment, or to globalization. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

One of the chief problems of these studies is the treatment of time. Very often, changes are incremental and their real impacts are not immediately visible but take years or even decades before the consequences fully materialize. The purpose of this paper is to discuss those incremental processes2014that consist of series of smaller "not-system-shifting changes"2014which may gradually change central features of a welfare state. Pension programmes, spanning long time periods, provide a good example. Only in some rare cases were pension schemes reformed in one step and in such a way that one can definitely ascertain a system shift. Most changes, however, are gradual, and recurrently enacted minor adjustments seem to leave the basic principles of the scheme intact. In this paper pension reform policies in Germany and Finland will be used to answer the question of when a change is big enough to be labelled as a system shift. It is argued that small "not-system-shifting" changes of the last two decades will eventually alter the basic characteristics of old-age security in both countries.},

	abstract = {Over a decade has passed since the collapse of communism, yet citizens of post-communist countries are still far less likely to join voluntary organizations than people from other countries and regions of the world. Why do post-communist citizens mistrust and avoid public organizations? What explains this distinctive pattern of weak civil society? And what does it mean for the future of democracy in post-communist Europe? In this engaging study, Marc Morjé Howard addresses these questions by developing a provocative argument about the powerful and enduring impact of the communist experience on its countries and citizens. Howard argues that the legacy of the communist experience of mandatory participation in state-controlled organizations, the development and persistence of vibrant private networks, and the tremendous disappointment with developments since the collapse of communism have left most post-communist citizens with a lasting aversion to public activities. In addition to analyzing data from over 30 democratic and democratizing countries in the World Values Survey, Howard presents extensive and original evidence from his own research in Eastern Germany and Russia, including in-depth interviews with ordinary citizens and an original representative survey.},

The second objective is to find out which factors have the largest impact on formation of optimistic expectations. The economic motivation of the research is constructed on the basis of previous studies that showed that optimistic expectations do influence economic behavior both on individual and firm’s level. To achieve the first objective I use data from the Life in Transition Survey that covers 29 transition countries. I come to general conclusion that not material well-being determines optimistic expectations. In contrast, optimistic expectations are determined by such factors as satisfaction with economic and political situation and life satisfaction, as well as by factors that reflect the level of trust towards government, society and financial institutions. To achieve the second goal I analyze the size of marginal effects and come to the conclusion that variables that reflect subjective perception of current life-circumstances have the largest effect on determination of optimistic expectations.},

Instead, the continuation of old policy patterns and adherence to traditional, pre-1989, criteria for benefit distribution contributed to the unprecedented expansion of public expenditures in relation to the {GDP.} In the mid-1990s failure to implement radical institutional reforms of the social insurance system has emerged as a major threat to political and economic stability in Poland.},

Both components of that hybrid are regarded as incompatible with the {'European} social model'. At the same time, most welfare reformers in {East-Central} Europe try to avoid falling into the trap of first, conserving the statist, inefficient and pseudo-egalitarian character of the old system of social policy; second, seeking new forms of welfare collectivism along the national-conservative/populist 'third roads' between capitalism and communism; third, triggering popular discontent by dismantling the old welfare regimes too rapidly, or in a haphazard way; and fourth, targeting an end-state which has become unsustainable in the Western world during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the emerging welfare regimes in the region are far from being identical and the reformers do not find stable institutional arrangements in the West to copy. In an effort to make sense of this complex picture, the paper examines what has 'really' happened in the welfare sectors in the region during the past decade by presenting three dominant narratives of the social transformation: 'leaping in the dark', 'marking time' and 'muddling through'.},

This paper uses worker-level data to characterize economy-wide job creation and job destruction during periods of massive structural adjustment. We contrast the gradualist Czech and the rapid Estonian approach to the destruction of the communist economy and assess their experience in light of selected theories of reallocation with frictions. We find that gradual job destruction combined with job creation support allows extensive reallocation to concur with low unemployment. Drastic job destruction, on the other hand, need not slow down job creation as long as unemployment benefits are kept very low.},

By combining data on social policy programs and data on income distribution, the authors compare trends between nations. The main question is, how successful have various sociopolitical solutions been in eliminating poverty? Here the focus is on family policy and pensions. Improvements in social policies have impacts on poverty cycles in all countries. In most countries poverty among the elderly has declined, and the young have replaced the old as the lowest income group. In many countries the poverty cycles have flattened out, and life phase is no longer as important as it used to be. Some differences between nations remain, however. High poverty rates among families continue to be an {Anglo-American} problem, and improvements in this area have been only marginal. Social policy provisions are important for explaining both cross-national variation in poverty and changes over time. The impact is clearest among pensioners. Family-related poverty is lowest in countries that have combined cash benefits with public child-care services that facilitate parents participation in the labor market.},

Who are the most vigorous opponents of means-testing, the middle classes or blue-collar workers? Results give some support to the hypothesis that selective benefits are the most unpopular. The study also shows that opinions on selectivity do not cluster in one dimension, but that there are several aspects of selectivity and that the attitudes of socio- economic groups vary depending on which aspect of selectivity is at stake. The working class and Social Democrats have more reservations toward selectivity which targets the needy, whereas they are more eager to introduce selectivity into universal welfare programs by discriminating against high-income earners. Salaried employees and voters of the Conservative Party are more reluctant to exclude well-to-do people from universal benefits, whereas they accept tighter means-testing in currently means- or income-tested schemes.},

The article focuses on the role played by the welfare state vis-à-vis {GDP} in the increase of life expectancy in 17 {OECD} countries 1900–2000. The article shows that money matters, war kills and the welfare state is good for health. There is a curvilinear relationship between prosperity and longevity: after a certain level, the marginal utility of an extra dollar levels off. In the longer run, growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The welfare state plays its role, too. Bigger is better, be it with regard to social spending or the generosity or coverage of social protection. For the life expectancy of a population to increase, it is better to have broader coverage or universal access to care than to have more generous benefits, which are channelled to a limited circle of citizens. It is better to give adequately to all than lavishly to too few. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

Another important lesson is that, while democratization often leads to greater pressures for social policy expansion, social policy can also contribute to democratization. The Nordic countries further demonstrate that is possible to unify social protection with a competitive and growth-oriented economy. In a number of policy areas, particularly in relation to social services and labor market policy, the Nordic countries have also become leading modernizers. The women-friendly dual-earner model not only combats poverty among families with children, but also enables women to participate in the labor market. The future sustainability of the Nordic model of social policy hinges on the number of taxpayers that can be mobilized. In order to be successful in this, governments need to take a combined, or holistic, approach, and consider both micro motives and macro considerations. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

The success of these strategies has been uneven in terms of their impact on fiscal resources and their overall effect on the distribution of income. However, they must also be assessed in terms of the support they have generated for political and economic system among economically vulnerable but politically influential middle-class, blue-collar, and rural social sectors.

	abstract = {Abstract  This article critiques the dominant neoliberal transition paradigm. The implementation of neoliberal reforms in the postcommunist
world has fostered the creation of two different types of capitalism. Rather than enabling a transition to Western European-style
capitalism, these reforms have produced divergence within the postcommunist world. This article uses comparative firm-level
case studies from Russia and Poland to construct a “neoclassical” sociological alternative to neoliberal theory that can explain
this divergence. In this account, intra-dominant class structure (the pattern of alliances between the Party bureaucracy,
the technocracy, and humanistic intellectuals) at the time of the transition produces different “paths to capitalism,” or
policy regimes, which, in turn, have different effects on the ability of firms to restructure. In Russia, this creates a system
of “patrimonial capitalism” that will produce long-term economic stagnation. In Poland, a variety of modern rational capitalism
emerges. This latter system is distinguished by its very high levels of dependence on capital imports in comparison to the
advanced capitalist countries. As a result, this type of economy will be quite vulnerable to economic shocks.},

Traditional arguments in favor of targeting and flat-rate benefits, focusing on the distribution of the money actually transferred, neglect three policy-relevant considerations: (1) The size of redistributive budgets is not fixed but reflects the structure of welfare state institutions. (2) A trade-off exists between the degree of low-income targeting and the size of redistributive budgets. (3) Outcomes of market-based distribution are often more unequal than those of earnings-related social insurance programs. We argue that social insurance institutions are of central importance for redistributive outcomes. Using new data, our comparative analyses of the effects of different institutional types of welfare states on poverty and inequality indicate that institutional differences lead to unexpected outcomes and generate the paradox of redistribution: The more we target benefits at the poor and the more concerned we are with creating equality via equal public transfers to all, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality.},

Both components of that hybrid are regarded as incompatible with the {'European} social model'. At the same time, most welfare reformers in {East-Central} Europe try to avoid falling into the trap of first, conserving the statist, inefficient and pseudo-egalitarian character of the old system of social policy; second, seeking new forms of welfare collectivism along the national-conservative/populist 'third roads' between capitalism and communism; third, triggering popular discontent by dismantling the old welfare regimes too rapidly, or in a haphazard way; and fourth, targeting an end-state which has become unsustainable in the Western world during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the emerging welfare regimes in the region are far from being identical and the reformers do not find stable institutional arrangements in the West to copy. In an effort to make sense of this complex picture, the paper examines what has 'really' happened in the welfare sectors in the region during the past decade by presenting three dominant narratives of the social transformation: 'leaping in the dark', 'marking time' and 'muddling through'.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the felt legitimacy of poverty and wealth in the United States, West Germany, The Netherlands, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Russia. Several theories on poverty and wealth perception are discussed; of these, dominant ideology theory has been the most influential. This theory can predict the existence not only of a legitimizing ideology in a society, but also of challenging beliefs that incumbents of specific social positions hold. It is argued that poverty and wealth perceptions are more complex, however, involving at least three latent dimensions. Using data from the International Social Justice Project it is demonstrated that, regarding poverty, individuals distinguish between merited, unmerited, and fatalistic types of poverty. Merited poverty is poverty brought about by the individual's own doing or not doing, unmerited poverty is due to forces external to the individual, whereas fatalistic explanations attribute poverty to ascribed properties of the individual. For wealth also there are three causally relevant factors: in addition to merited und unmerited ones, a social capital factor that sees social contacts as a source for determining economic success. Using a structural equation approach and its group comparison option for comparing countries, the different explanations of poverty and wealth are translated into specific measurement models. Testing simultaneously with linear regression models show how preferences for particular explanations are shaped by stratification-related experiences and by the social position of an observer.},

Our study starts from the premise that the countries under scrutiny represent different kinds of welfare state regimes. The concept of social capital we separate here into bonding social capital, bridging social capital, generalized trust and informal support. Our main question is whether or not social capital varies systematically between different welfare state regimes. In this respect, our aim is to put to the test two opposite assumptions: the society-centred hypothesis that assumes that strong welfare states may weaken the preconditions in which social capital emerges and the institution-centred hypothesis that assumes that social capital emerges expressly in societies with strong welfare state institutions. Although mainly confirming the latter assumption, our research findings also emphasize the fact that the different forms of social capital are connected to welfare state regimes in different ways. On the basis of our results, it is possible that the welfare state both prevents and promotes the development of social capital, depending on the respective meanings given to social capital.1},

	abstract = {Why are people who live in liberal welfare regimes so reluctant to support welfare policy? And why are people who live in social democratic welfare regimes so keen to support welfare policy? This article seeks to give an institutional account of these cross-national differences. Previous attempts to link institutions and welfare attitudes have not been convincing. The empirical studies have had large difficulties in finding the expected effects from regime-dependent differences in self-interest, class interest, and egalitarian values. This article develops a new theoretical macro--micro link by combining the literature on deservingness criteria and the welfare regime theory. The basic ideas are that three regime characteristics, (a) the degree of universalism in welfare policy, (b) the differences in economic resources between "the bottom" and "the majority," and (c) the degree of job opportunities, have a profound impact on the public deservingness discussion and thereby on public support for welfare policy.},

he rate of poverty varies between 10\% and 23\% in the countries of the European Union. Low levels of poverty characterize the Scandinavian countries, the so-called Corporatist countries {(Austria,} Germany), and the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia among the {ex-Socialist} countries. In contract, the risk of poverty tends to be relatively high in the Mediterranean and the Baltic states. This Policy Brief discusses the sensitivity of these estimates to the measures used and explores the underlying patterns across the vulnerable groups and the likely causes of poverty in these countries.},

However, from the statistical mode and time series of rural socio-economic statistical survey, we know that the statistical data have both spatial and temporal attribute, so the traditional systems have no enough ability to manage and analyze the statistical data with spatio-temporal attribute. In this paper, on the basis of the former research and the real demands of rural socio-economic statistic department, four key techniques about the construction of spatial management and analysis system for rural socioeconomic statistic data were designed. Based on the statistical spatio-temporal database, historical statistical data spatio-temporal division, statistical model library, exploratory spatial statistical analysis method techniques, the integrative operational system was realized for spatio-temporal data management, analysis and thematic mapping or expression. It could be utilized in many aspects of operational work of rural socio-economic statistic administration.},

Second, the 1990s brought large declines in the share of high-poverty (sub-county) areas and the share of people, including poor people, who lived in them. Third, poor minorities—both in metro and non-metro areas—are highly ghettoized in high-poverty neighbourhoods and are highly segregated from whites and the nonpoor population. Discussions of concentrated poverty cannot be uncoupled from minority residence patterns.},

It provides a general overview of the system's evolution in three stages: (1) the pre-reform period when a system of enterprise welfare was in operation; (2) a period of system transition; (3) the stage when state welfare began to take shape. These developmental trends are interpreted on the basis of three types of institutional relations: the State-enterprise relation, the enterprise- (or employer-) employee relation, and the {individual/worker-State} relation. Moreover, the discussion deals with policy perceptions at each stage of the developmental process. Based on these analyses, it illustrates the transformation of the Chinese social security system in a broad socioeconomic and political context, where China struggled to establish a modern, market-based enterprise system. The paper thus expounds issues of socialism, market forces and the power of organized labour.},

Historical engagement with this topic creates a distinct conceptual lens on poverty and inequality and a voluminous body of empirical work that set sociology apart from economics and to some degree, geography. At the same time, the discipline is limited in developing a spatial understanding of stratification processes. In this article, we put forth a critique of sociological research on poverty and other inequalities across space. We focus on a disciplinary impasse, the lack of a coherent, well-developed tradition at the subnational or regional scale. Drawing from research on the United States, we address how sociologists are making inroads against this impasse, in an emergent body of work.},

These reforms dramatically transformed the way these countries provide retirement income, and they provoked widespread protests from workers and pensioners alike. Retiring the State represents the first book-length study of the origins of this surprising trend.

Drawing on original field research, including interviews with key policymakers, Madrid argues that the recent reforms were driven not by social policy, but by macroeconomic concerns. Countries facing growing financial pressures chose to privatize their pension systems largely to boost their domestic savings rates and reduce public pension spending in the long run. The author explores his arguments through detailed case studies of pension reform in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, a survey of social security privatization efforts in East Europe and Latin America as a whole, and a quantitative analysis of pension privatization worldwide.},

Yet, disappointingly, the impact of geography on the policy realm has been limited. Increasingly, it seems, other social, political and environmental scientists, and even media pundits, shape public perception and government policy in areas where we as geographers could – indeed should – be having much greater influence. In this article I examine the reasons for this state of affairs. The fundamental problem, I argue, is that for a variety of reasons much contemporary social and economic geography research renders it of little practical relevance for policy, in some cases of little social relevance at all. The more significant reasons for this lack of relevance to, and influence on, the policy realm include: the effects on the subject of the postmodern and cultural ‘turns’; the consequential emphasis on ‘sexy’ philosophical, linguistic and theoretical issues rather than on practical social research; the retreat from detailed, rigorous empirical work; the intellectual bias against policy studies; and the lack of political commitment. The article makes a plea for a new ‘policy turn’ in the discipline, and concludes with some tentative suggestions for how we might move towards a ‘geography of public policy’.},

	abstract = {ns to poverty and income inequality during the early period of transition to a market economy? Poverty is on the rise, and income inequality widens. Better targeting of social assistance and pension reform are the necessary policy reforms. In examining what happens to poverty and income inequality during the early period of transition to a market economy, Milanovic covers the period up to 1993. His analysis includes almost all transition economies that were not affected by wars, blockades, or embargoes. {(In} economies so affected, the intrinsic issues of transition are overshadowed by more basic issues of war or quasi-war economy and survival.) The two key issues of social policy in transition economies are pension reform and better targeting of social assistance. Pensions represent 70 to 80 percent of cash social expenditures. No reduction of current levels of social spending (which is unsustainable) can be envisaged without pension reform. Better targeting of social assistance is needed because many universally or enterprise-provided benefits have been terminated, poverty has increased, and social programs lack funding. If poverty is on the rise and money is scarce, better targeting is the only option. This paper - a product of the Transition Economics Division, Policy Research Department - is part of a larger effort in the department to study social effects of transition.},

	abstract = {beginning of transition to market economy, inequality has increased in all transition countries. The factors driving inequality up: increasing wage inequality (as workers move from a relatively egalitarian state sector to a less equal private sector), and the rising share of income from self-employment and property (both very unequally distributed). Social transfers have failed to dampen the increase in inequality because they have remained, as under socialism, unfocused. The transition from planned to market economy has witnessed one of the biggest and fastest increases in inequality ever recorded. On average, inequality in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union increased from a Gini coefficient of 25?28 (below the {OECD} average) to 35?38 (above {OECD} average) in less than 10 years. In some countries, such as Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine, the increase in inequality has been even more dramatic, outpacing the yearly speed of Gini increase in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1980s by three to four times. What are the factors pushing inequality up? Milanovic constructs a simple model of transition defined as the removal of restriction on private sector development. As the private sector becomes free, it attracts workers who leave the shrinking state sector. Wage inequality in the private sector is greater than in the old, relatively egalitarian state sector. This is one of the forces pushing inequality up. The second is the growth of income from self-employment and property, both of which are fairly unequal sources of income both before the transition and now. In addition, some of the released state sector workers remain unemployed. Their incomes decline. Increased inequality is thus accompanied by the hollowing out of the middle class (where the middle class is defined as the former state sector workers). One part of state sector workers moves to higher incomes as workers in the private sector or entrepreneurs; another remains jobless. The model is contrasted with the actual developments in six transition economies: Bulgaria (over 1989-95), Hungary (1987-93), Latvia (1989-96), Poland (1987-95), Russia (1989-94), and Slovenia (1987-95). In all countries, wage inequality has increased (in some, like Russia, dramatically); income from self-employment has remained as unequal as before but its share in total income has risen, and the importance of social transfers in total income has increased, but its focus on the poor has not improved.

	abstract = {Summary: This book is about income, inequality, and poverty during the remarkable period of collapse of Communism and the construction of capitalism in the 18 formerly socialist countries. It covers a period of almost ten years, from the time of the early Gorbachevian reforms of 1987-88 to approximately 1996. The goal of this book is to describe what happened during the transition in the 18 countries. Specifically the book examines what happened to the real incomes of the population, to the inequality with which incomes and expenditures are distributed, and to poverty. It also attempts to find out why these changes occurred. In looking ahead, the book concludes that if growth is to make a substantial dent in poverty relatively quickly, it will be necessary to stabilize income inequality at current levels. Assuming that inequality remains at current levels, and using the average growth rate of 5 percent per capita per year, poverty appears to be staying in these transition economies until well into the twenty-first century. The surveys are of uneven quality. Issues related to limitations of the data are presented at length in Appendix 1.},

However, they have not put forward any general theory of the effect of cross-border contact on perceptions. This paper shows that social psychological contact theory, if applied to borderlands studies, can uncover the factors that influence citizen relations across national borders and under what conditions.
Using opinion poll data from the {Czech-German} border region as an example, this paper shows that the Saxon and Bavarian regions bordering the Czech Republic are areas of high interaction density. Mediator analysis is used to decompose the direct and indirect effects of geographical proximity and contact on attitudes towards the Czech neighbours.
Contact in the Saxon border region produces more favourable attitudes than elsewhere in Germany. However, contact does not have the same effect in the Bavarian border region: Bavarian attitudes are less favourable than elsewhere in Germany. The paper shows that {Bavarian-Czech} relations are weighed down by historical stumbling blocks, notably the influence of the {post-World} War {II} expellees from Czechoslovakia who are an important political force in Bavaria. The expellees issue demonstrates the need to take into account cultural factors when applying contact theory to the borderlands context.},

It is increasingly accepted that "institutions matter" for economic organization and outcomes. The last decade has seen significant expansion in research examining how institutional contexts affect the nature and behavior of firms, the operation of markets, and economic outcomes. Yet "institutions" conceal a multitude of issues and perspectives. Much of this research has been comparative, and followed different models such as "varieties of capitalism", "national business systems", and "social systems of production".

This Handbook explores these issues, perspectives, and models, with the leading scholars in the area contributing chapters to provide a central reference point for academics, scholars, and students.
Features

    * Covers models such as 'varieties of capitalism', 'national business systems', and 'social systems of production'.
    * Chapters by leading international scholars

This proposition is examined in the context of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union using data from three waves of the World Values Survey. Contrary to expectations, the authors find little evidence of a 'socialist legacy' en bloc. Considering the former Soviet Union separately from other post-socialist countries, the analysis finds that as a group these countries display significantly lower preference for moving toward greater income equality than both Eastern Europe and other comparator groups (developed and developing countries). These findings hold up even when controlling for the conventional determinants of attitudes such as income level and employment status of the individual respondent, as well as national factors such as per-capita income and its distribution. Moreover, the preference for greater income inequality appears to have persisted at least since the mid-1990s and possibly since the early 1990s (data difficulties preclude a robust examination of this latter question). The results are consistent with the fairly low levels of public spending on redistribution commonly found in the former Soviet Union.},

This chapter reviews recent research on China, highlighting the theoretical arguments and findings of general interest to social scientists. The paper argues that a paradigm shift is taking place within research on China, from state-centered analysis to a theoretical approach that locates causal forces within a macrosocietal framework. Within a macrosocietal framework, state socialism is viewed as a distinctive institutional arrangement in which society, economy, and the state are integrated through society-wide redistributive arrangements. Forces in economic and political change emanate not only from political actors but from economic and social actors as well. The chapter reviews work in which a macrosocietal approach is used to address stratification, societal transformation, and marketization in reforming Chinese state socialism. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	abstract = {The issue of what people consider as reasons for living in poverty is often neglected in the literature on poverty. Studies of public perceptions are needed both on academic grounds and in terms of policy-making processes. In this article, I study three different meanings of poverty: the individualistic, the fatalistic and the structural. I explore whether different meanings can be attributed to specific socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes towards the welfare state. The data derive from a cross-sectional survey conducted in Finland in 2005 and the results indicate that there is strong consensus in the Finnish population on the causes of poverty. Finns are more likely to blame the flaws and inadequacies of the labour market than the behaviour of individuals or societal injustice. In other words, structural explanations of poverty have the greatest support. However, fatalistic explanations are also supported, since a considerable proportion of people regard bad luck and lack of opportunities as reasons for poverty. Applied multivariate analysis indicates that perceptions of the causes of poverty are at least to some extent related to socio-demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and attitudes to the welfare state. However, the effects, as well as the group differences, are small.},

	abstract = {Rapid education expansion and rising income inequality are two striking phenomena occurring in China during the transitional period. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey {(CHNS)} data collected in 1997 and 2006, this paper studies how education affects individual earnings during the transitional process. We find that education accounts for only a small fraction of the personal earnings and income gap between different groups. We analyze the underlying mechanism of the impact of education on earning. More educated people tend to enter state-owned sectors, have a low probability of changing jobs in the labor market and work less time; all of these will have a pronounced impact on earning and income inequality. Quantile regression analysis shows that the low-income group's education return rate is lower, which helps little in narrowing the income gap. We decompose the earning gap into four factors: population effect, price effect, labor choice effect and un-observed effect. In explaining the earning gap in China, the price effect is more important than the population effect. The labor choice effect is also significant. We conclude that increasing educational expenditure with no complementary measures such as reforming the education system and establishing a competitive labor market helps less in reducing income inequality.},

of targeting efficiency and poverty reduction taking the introduction of means tested child
benefits in Russia as a case study. We use the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey
{(RLMS)} from 2000 to 2004 to analyse the impact of the reforms and to simulate the effects of
various means-tested and universal child benefit schemes. Since the reforms in 2000, more
children receive benefits and there is improved targeting of low income households.
Nevertheless, both inclusion and exclusion errors are considerable and although the poverty
reduction impact improved marginally since the reforms, its effect on child poverty is small.
Our simulations show that universal schemes achieve additional poverty reductions in all
indicators because previously excluded children now also receive a benefit. But size matters
most; only by increasing benefit levels considerably, more substantial poverty reductions can
be achieved.},

	abstract = {When Vladimir Putin claimed “outside forces” were at work during the Ukrainian Orange Revolution of 2004, it was not just a case of paranoia. In this uprising against election fraud, protesters had been trained in political organization and nonviolent resistance by a Western-financed democracy building coalition. Putin's accusations were more than just a call to xenophobic impulses-they were a testament to the pervasive influence of transnational actors in the shaping of postcommunist countries. Despite this, the role of transnational actors has been downplayed or dismissed by many theorists. Realists maintain that only powerful states assert major influence, while others argue that transnational actors affect only rhetoric, not policy outcomes. The editors of this volume contend that transnational actors have exerted a powerful influence in postcommunist transitions. They demonstrate that transitions to democracy, capitalism, and nation-statehood, which scholars thought were likely to undermine one another, were facilitated by the integration of Central and East European states into an international system of complex interdependence. Transnational actors turn out to be the “dark matter” that held the various aspects of the transition together. Transnational actors include international governmental and nongovernmental organizations, corporations, banks, foundations, religious groups, and activist networks, among others. The European Union is the most visible transnational actor in the region, but there are many others, including the {OSCE,} {NATO,} Council of Europe, the Catholic Church, and the Soros Foundation. Transnational Actors in Central and East European Transitions assembles leading scholars to debate the role and impact of transnational actors and presents a promising new research program for the study of this rapidly transforming region.},

While neoliberal reform programs appeared to have finally produced rapid economic growth in the 2000s after a long transitional recession, the 2008 global economic meltdown plunged Central and East European countries back into crisis. This article offers a mixed assessment of the results of neoliberal economic reforms and questions the easy compatibility of democracy and radical reform observed during the 1990s. Since the 2000s, both democratic and authoritarian countries in Eastern Europe have experienced rapid growth. Geopolitics, more than reform or democracy, seems to separate the winners from the losers. Successful countries are those that either joined the European Union or developed close political and economic relations with Russia. Those betwixt and between and those suffering internal strife (or both) still have not reached 1989 levels of economic production.},

	abstract = {After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the countries of {East-Central} Europe embarked on a journey to transform themselves into democratic capitalist societies. Their governments searched for strategies that would allow them to pursue radical market reforms within the context of nascent democratic politics. Poland adopted a neoliberal strategy that attempted to push through as much reform as possible before an antireform backlash could occur. In the Czech Republic, a social liberal strategy for transformation attempted to combine neoliberal macro-economic policies with social democratic measures designed to avert such a backlash.
A detailed analysis of Poland and the Czech Republic suggests that alternation between strategies has been the secret to the success of {East-Central} European countries.
This comparative case analysis identifies the significance of reform mistakes during transition and the corrective benefits of policy alternation, its claims illustrated with an in-depth study of privatization policy in the two countries.
Mitchell A. Orenstein delves into the historic struggle to build capitalism and democracy during a decade of post- communist transition in {East-Central} Europe and develops a model that explains why democratic policy alternation may accelerate policy learning under conditions of uncertainty and constraint.
Out of the Red is accessible to a general audience and as such is suitable for both graduate and undergraduate courses on political economy. It will be of particular interest to economists, political scientists, sociologists, students of postcommunism, and anyone interested in the relations between capitalism and democracy in the contemporary world.

	abstract = {How did the fall of communism and the subsequent transition to capitalism in Eastern Europe affect the people who experienced it? And how did their anger affect the quality of the democratic systems that have emerged? Poland offers a particularly provocative case, for it was here where workers most famously seemed to have won, thanks to the role of the Solidarity trade union. And yet, within a few short years, they had clearly lost. An oppressive communist regime gave way to a capitalist society that embraced economic and political inequality, leaving many workers frustrated and angry. Their leaders first ignored them, then began to fear them, and finally tried to marginalize them. In turn, workers rejected their liberal leaders, opening the way for right-wing nationalists to take control of Solidarity. Ost tells a fascinating story about the evolution of postcommunist society in Eastern Europe. Informed by years of fieldwork in Polish factory towns, scores of interviews with workers, labor activists, and politicians, and an exhaustive reading of primary sources, his new book gives voice to those who have not been heard. But even more, Ost proposes a novel theory about the role of anger in politics to show why such voices matter, and how they profoundly affect political outcomes. Drawing on Poland's experiences, Ost describes lessons relevant to democratization throughout Eastern Europe and to democratic theory in general.},

This follows from assessing the relationship between poverty and remoteness as well as labour supply responses.

Previous discussions have generally relied, at least implicitly, on a reflexive application of theories designed to explain welfare state expansion. Such an approach is seriously flawed. Not only is the goal of retrenchment (avoiding blame for cutting existing programs) far different from the goal of expansion (claiming credit for new social benefits), but the welfare state itself vastly alters the terrain on which the politics of social policy is fought out. Only an appreciation of how mature social programs create a new politics can allow us to make sense of the welfare state's remarkable resilience over the past two decades of austerity. Theoretical argument is combined with quantitative and qualitative data from four cases {(Britain,} the United States, Germany, and Sweden) to demonstrate the shortcomings of conventional wisdom and to highlight the factors that limit or facilitate retrenchment success.},

The investigation of increasing returns can provide a more rigorous framework for developing some of the key claims of recent scholarship in historical institutionalism: Specific patterns of timing and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible; large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic contours of social life.},

Most contemporary social scientists unconsciously take a "snapshot" view of the social world. Yet the meaning of social events or processes is frequently distorted when they are ripped from their temporal context. Paul Pierson argues that placing politics in time--constructing "moving pictures" rather than snapshots--can vastly enrich our understanding of complex social dynamics, and greatly improve the theories and methods that we use to explain them. Politics in Timeopens a new window on the temporal aspects of the social world. It explores a range of important features and implications of evolving social processes: the variety of processes that unfold over significant periods of time, the circumstances under which such different processes are likely to occur, and above all, the significance of these temporal dimensions of social life for our understanding of important political and social outcomes. Ranging widely across the social sciences, Pierson's analysis reveals the high price social science pays when it becomes ahistorical. And it provides a wealth of ideas for restoring our sense of historical process. By placing politics back in time, Pierson's book is destined to have a resounding and enduring impact on the work of scholars and students in fields from political science, history, and sociology to economics and policy analysis.},

Examination of three areas of reconciliation, that is, childcare services, maternity and parental leaves, and parent-friendly organization of work, reveals strong tensions between the unpaid labour of care and paid market labour. Reconciliation of work and family appears challenging for mothers and fathers alike, but the nature of the problem differs 2013 women face greater obstacles to paid employment and men to involvement in family and care. Assessed against {EU} prescriptions in this area, Poland's performance is mixed. Based on policy developments and practice, Poland is far from achieving Barcelona targets for the provision of childcare services, it complies with {EU} regulations on maternity and parental leave arrangements but also compares unfavourably with the member states which provide special arrangements for fathers, and, finally, lags behind employment goals and parent-friendly organization of work. Although participation in the Lisbon Strategy has proved important for raising the visibility of the reconciliation of work and family policies on the national political agenda, recent policy reforms have been either inconsistent or too modest in light of {EU} policy goals. Therefore, it is too soon to argue that parents' ability to reconcile work and care has improved or that greater equality in the gendered division of labour has been attained.},

Compulsory social and health insurance were re-introduced in the early 1990s, along with a guaranteed subsistence minimum for all, and an institutionalized state employment policy. This paper argues that {EU-derived} policies have had only a limited impact on Czech social-policy reform, focusing mostly on institution building. This phenomenon can be attributed to the apparent discrepancy between Copenhagen criteria of accession (1993) and the Lisbon Strategy, which was accepted as a policy guideline in 2002. Thus, the main concept able to explain Czech social-policy development after 1989 is that of institutional and behavioural path dependency as the country exhibited resistance to change coupled with a strong adherence to the Bismarckian, corporatist, welfare state. This makes the Czech Republic a special case compared to the other Visegrad countries, where the pressure from neo-liberal public-policy concepts of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund found its expression in the introduction of more residual social policies.},

In measuring global income or consumption expenditure poverty, the World Bank has widely adopted the \$1 a day standard as a lower bound. Because this standard is based on poverty lines in the poorest countries, anyone with income or expenditures below this line will truly be poor. But there is no consensus standard for the upper bound of the global poverty line: above what level of income or expenditures is someone truly not poor? This article proposes that the World Bank compute its lower and upper bounds in a methodologically equivalent way, using the poverty lines of the poorest countries for the lower bound and the poverty lines of the richest countries for the upper bound. The resulting upper bound global poverty line would be 10 times higher than the current lower bound and at least 5 times higher than the currently used alternative lower bound of \$2 a day. And in tracking progress toward a world free of poverty, the World Bank should compute measures of global poverty using a variety of weights on the depth and intensity of poverty for a range of poverty lines between the global lower and upper bounds. For instance, rather than trying to artificially force the global population of 6.2 billion (a billion is 1,000 million) into just two categories "poor" and "not poor," with the new range of poverty lines the estimates would be that 1.3 billion people are "destitute" (below \$1 a day), another 1.6 billion are in "extreme poverty" (above \$1 a day but below \$2 dollar a day), and another 2.5 billion are in "global poverty" (above extreme poverty but below the upper bound poverty line).},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to shed light on some implications of using direct versus indirect poverty measures and standard household equivalence scales for the analysis of poverty and social exclusion in Romania. The argumentation builds on the study of Éltető and Havasi (2002), who investigated the effects of introducing the modified {OECD} equivalence scale (recommended by {EUROSTAT)} for poverty estimates in Hungary. For Romania, similar critiques of the modified {OECD} scale had been traced by Molnar (1999) and Teşliuc et. al. (2003). Given the structure of household expenditures in Romania, the high costs of raising children and the small value of state transfers for children and the family, it can be said that the weight assigned to children by the modified {OECD} scale is too small and leads to an inaccurate picture on the configuration of poverty.
On the basis of statistical analyses performed upon the 2003 World Bank poverty assessment report dataset, it is argued that the application of the modified {OECD} equivalence scale is highly likely to underestimate the poverty rate in Romania, especially among the households with two or more children. Although the initial {OECD} scale shows a relatively lower poverty rate of households with elderly members, these rates approximate better the results of previous researches than those of the modified {OECD} scale.
The methodological choice for using indicators of household consumption or income should be carefully grounded, given that correlations between these two indicators are rather weak. Whereas both relative measures based on income (excluding the value of goods produced for household consumption) and those based on consumption indicate poverty rates higher than 25\%, only 15\% of the households fall below both poverty thresholds.},

per se, which fuels further inequalities. The engagement to limit the amount of
insecurity faced by individuals is embedded in the very notions of social

salient in the case of public health care systems. State retrenchment from the

Disparities in the Use of Public Health Care Services in the {North-West} Development

system are investigated: coverage (having or not health insurance), knowledge
about rights and duties, and trust in the system. The results are discussed in

adults. Young people can have a dynamic outlook on life, seeking to maximize

optimum strategy is to secure a stable equilibrium; the alternative is continuing
deterioration leading to death. In the words of Meinhard Miegel, {'Older} people
grow averse to change, risks and experiments; they value security and
predictability; become less entrepreneurial, more conservative' (quoted in Benoit,
2008). Instead of seeking to maximize income by extracting the maximum
pension from the fisc, older people are more likely to have a satisficing
approach, wanting enough (in Latin: satis; see Simon, 1978) to be secure, that
is, to feel protected from the threats of advancing age. From the bottom up perspective of older people, the aim is to have a mix of resources from the
state, the market and informal social networks that can be used to provide for
their satisfactions {(Rose,} 1986).},

In this paper, we study support attitudes for both the economic and political transition using data from the New Barometer Surveys for 14 transition economies from 1991 to 2004. We document that the overall support is low and heterogeneous across countries and individuals. Support attitudes are lower among the old, less skilled, unemployed, poor, and those living in the {CIS} countries. There seems to be an increasing trend in the support for the economic transition in most countries. Our findings are robust to changes in the definition and measurement of the dependent variable. We also find evidence that transition-related hardship, opinions on the speed of reforms, political preferences and preferences towards redistribution, ideology and social capital matter. Finally, we show that individual preferences for secure jobs, the role of state and trust in politicians as well as better institutions, in particular, the quality of governance, seem to contribute mostly to explaining the lower levels of the support in the {CIS} countries.},

	abstract = {The advance of economic globalization has led many academics, policy-makers, and activists to warn that it leads to a 'race to the bottom'. In a world increasingly free of restrictions on trade and capital flows, developing nations that cut public services are risking detrimental effects to the populace. Conventional wisdom suggests that it is the poorer members of these societies who stand to lose the most from these pressures on welfare protections, but this new study argues for a more complex conceptualization of the subject. Nita Rudra demonstrates how and why domestic institutions in developing nations have historically ignored the social needs of the poor; globalization neither takes away nor advances what never existed in the first place. It has been the lower- and upper-middle classes who have benefited the most from welfare systems and, consequently, it is they who are most vulnerable to globalization’s race to the bottom.

• Uncovers a novel paradox that in the 'race to the bottom' it is not the poor who are getting hurt • Demonstrates how globalisation affects public policies in developing and developed countries differently • Compares the history and recent changes in the social policies of India, Brazil, and Korea},

But it has been realized that energy subsidy has led to market distortion and welfare loss. Hence, elimination of energy subsidy is considered as a crucial matter. Changes in energy policy are hindered by the uncertainty on the impact of reducing energy subsidy on the living expenses of population. In the present article the distribution of resources through energy subsidy is evaluated; and, the direct and indirect effect of eliminating energy subsidies on the living expenses is estimated with the help of an analytical tool that has been developed. It is then concluded that additional financial resources obtained from reduction of energy subsidies could be allocated for compensating the decrease in purchasing power of households. The results of analysis reveal that more egalitarian distribution of resources and helping the poor could be achieved through implementation of a progressive policy of social security that is supported by financial resources available from elimination of energy subsidies.},

During the 1990s the poverty rates increased in most countries and for most vulnerable groups. Means-tested benefits assumed growing importance in alleviating poverty, and several countries have improved their schemes to guarantee a minimum income. At the same time reforms have produced diversity in the safety nets across Europe.},

Governments have often zig-zagged in their policies and resorted to symbolic reforms at times rather than implementing ideologically based, consistent policies. We argue that historical and sociological institutionalism combined with a social-capital approach can explain this decay better than the more common arguments about economic pressures combined with ideological hegemony or the protest-avoidance strategy. In particular, the social capital approach adds to our institutional framework by explaining why cutbacks in welfare programmes have not met much opposition, even though public opinion surveys consistently show support for more generous welfare policies, and why policies have deviated so much from political rhetoric.},

European sociologists rely heavily on such an informative descriptor as occupation, which has become institutionalized and thus produces certain requirements of human, social and cultural resources for individuals to perform the underlying functions. However, this indicator manifests at least two substantial restrictions: first, it is natural that certain types of economic activity are historically less stable than the social classes with which they are associated; and second, Russian history demonstrates that in a developed society the system of occupations is consistent with its institutional set-up and system of values, which are transferred from generation to generation. In Russia specific occupations are associated with a certain character of labour yet not with particular status characteristics that should result from the corporate nature of professional associations. In fact, in that society there exists a unique form of social stratification, in which a hierarchy of social estates dominates elements of true class differentiation. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

As a consequence of the search for cost effectiveness/reduction we observe a convergence in how the care market is organised: all countries are moving towards home care, private provision and cash transfers. The aim of this paper is twofold. It is argued that the way in which elderly care is provided and financed may entail considerable differences in the creation of a formal care market. National employment models in turn shape the features of the care labour market, affecting both the quantity and quality of care labour supply, the extent of the care labour shortage, and the degree of dependence on migrant carers. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various European country models of elderly care to show how these two factors combine to shape the characteristics of elderly care regimes, and their differing capacity to meet increasing demand for care either by using native workers or, alternatively, by turning to immigrant workers in order to cope with labour shortages.},

However, the actual price of labor hardly reacts, because the welfare state's minimum replacement incomes are fixed. The rigidity of wages causes pathological overreactions of the European economy in terms of excessive capital exports, excessive immigration and excessive structural change towards the capital intensive export sectors. The overreactions cause unemployment, sluggish growth, a current account surplus and a high export volume, but may prevent gains from trade. Moving from a system of wage replacement incomes to one that pays wage subsidies would enable a more efficient economic reaction that would not jeopardize social goals but bring about more employment, growth and gains from trade.},

	abstract = {n enlargement of the {EU} resembles German unification in its momentousness. Whereas the latter led to a 26\% increase in the population of the Federal Republic, the former will increase the population of the {EU} by 28\% if all ten entry aspirants are accepted. A special problem will be posed by migration. Given the existing wage differences between eastern and western European countries, a massive westward migration can be expected after enlargement. A temporary east-to-west migration until the eastern countries create an efficient capital stock makes economic sense if this is driven by wage differences and meets with a flexible labour market. Migration does not make economic sense, however, if, and to the extent that, it is induced by the current social assistance systems. Moreover, welfare-motivated migration would create competition among western European states to frighten off potential migrants, and this would lead to an erosion of the traditional social welfare state. If the {EU} plan incorporated limitation on the free movement of labour, beneficial migration would also cease. A better solution would be to limit access to the western social systems, at least for a transitional period, in order to filter out migration induced by differing social standards. An {EU-wide} application of the home-country principle in the granting of social benefits would achieve this goal.},

The analysis is mostly based on data from the Czech Survey on Social Conditions of Households (2001; 27,000 respondents); Eurostat data provide a benchmark for making international comparisons. The poverty rate in the Czech Republic is among the lowest in Europe. On the other hand, material deprivation, as well as concentration of poverty within specific population groups, is high, with the unemployed facing the highest risk of poverty. Social policy measures in effect reinforce this pattern: while the benefit system is highly redistributive and effectively eliminates income poverty among households of employed persons and among pensioners, incomes of persons outside paid employment are protected less effectively. Labour market policy measures are insufficient in scope and inadequate in targeting groups which are facing the highest risk of labour market exclusion and poverty. We argue that although this practice is effective at present, it is not sustainable in the long term.},

	abstract = {overnments of countries undergoing a post-communist transition face the dilemma of balancing
conflicting demands for greater economic efficiency (to achieve a successful transition to a market
system) with demands for enhanced social protection (to legitimize regime change through a visible
improvement in living standards which includes vulnerable groups). This paper analyses the
transition in Bulgaria and Romania. Unlike other European countries, these countries did not
embark on retrenchment policies until the mid- to late s, so convergence with policies of
spending constraint elsewhere in Europe was belated and partial. The social problems created by
strict economic policies, exacerbated by a determination to reorganize the post-communist welfare
states along the lines promoted by international organizations, are now being recognized. Post-
communist governments in South-eastern Europe have belatedly started to address the social
aspects of transition to democracy and the market. This probably reflects the process of regime
change in Bulgaria and Romania, which has been characterized as a “two-step transition to
democracy”, with liberal governments only succeeding transformed communist elites in power after
a protracted transition.},

Among the latter are the perceived actual justice of the society, the perceived size of the middle class, and the personal position in the system of inequalities. Despite the economic hardships and a rise in inequalities in both countries, individualistic explanations of wealth and poverty have increased over the 5 years between the surveys. At the same time respondents in both countries demonstrated a growing awareness of the importance of starting positions and connections to achieve wealth. The perceived middle class has a significant effect on attributions of poverty but not on wealth. Russians in Estonia have a particular bias against wealth, whereas {non-Russians} in Russia are more likely to justify wealth on the basis of individual merit. Explanations of poverty and wealth in Estonia are more rooted in the factors of socialization (age, education, and gender), whereas in Russia they are more rooted in the changes in the family financial circumstances between 1991 and 1996.

She relocates Soviet-type societies on the semi-periphery of the capitalist world system. In addition she offers a critique of capitalism that pivots on the two connected issues of over production and ecological crisis. She makes the distinction between an anti-globalism critique and a globalization critique, locating herself in the latter.

	abstract = {During the transition and accession process in Hungary the questions of
the fairness and efficiency of the welfare arrangements came to the forefront
of public discussions and political contestation. The key questions concerned
the type of welfare state arising on the ruins of the old state-socialist regime.
The author investigates whether new welfare state resembles any of the “three
worlds of welfare capitalism”, what is the role of the {EU} in their formation,
and whether differences are merely a matter of the level of economic develop-
ment or deep-rooted systemic causes and policies. The first part of the paper
outlines competing visions on the transformation of the socialist state and it is
followed by the presentation of ideological and political arguments standing
behind the implemented measures in the field of social policy and the wider role
of these measures in overall economic transformation. The author argues that
the consequences of these measures in social policy, most notably increased
poverty, though often considered as transitory, proved to be more permanent.
Also, economic recovery has not brought the improvement of social services
and local welfare assistance as expected. The second part of the paper offers
a critical review of causes that brought about such a contrast between the
declared goals and the actual results of the reform. The author argues that,
contrary to the initial expectations of increased efficiency, batter targeting,
and more social justice, the combined steps of funding cuts and decentraliza-
tion of decisions failed to decrease poverty, while at the same time increased
stigmatizing of recipients. The author concludes that Hungary’s recent devel-
opments point toward the crystallization of a distinguishable fourth type of
the welfare state developing more or less independently from the influence of
supranational welfare arrangements of the {EU.}},

In the analysis, the fuzzy set ideal types approach is utilized. In contrast to the studies conducted so far, this article stops treating the region of Cental and Eastern Europe as a monolith and demonstrates the existence of cross-country variation of childcare policies within the region. Furthermore, the difference is systematized by identifying four clusters of childcare policy. These are : explicit familialism, implicit familialism, female mobilizing and comprehensive support types. The countries are clustered as follows: the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia in the explicit familism policy model; Estonia and Latvia in the female mobilizing type policy; Lithuania and Hungary pursuing the childcare policies typical of the comprehensive support model; and finally the childcare policy in Poland resembles characteristics of the implicit familism model.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of how European welfare systems are responding to current pressures agree that welfare states display remarkable resilience. They are being reformed rather than dismantled. New policies are concerned to contain costs and to promote activation, stressing the contribution of welfare to economic competitiveness. Will people support cost constraint? This paper analyses attitude survey data from the 1980s and 1990s to show that approval of the main welfare services is high, but, in contrast to the findings of earlier studies, there is now some evidence of declining support. Attitudes are not structured according to the accounts of the new politics' of welfare (which imply that each regime will produce its own pattern of interests in relation to the groups whose interests are entrenched by current arrangements) but reflect broad lines of income, age and gender, cross-cutting national differences. There is little support for cuts in social services, but an equally low level of willingness to pay the extra taxes and social contributions required to maintain current standards of provision in the face of rising pressures on welfare. An agenda of activation is likely to prove more acceptable politically than one of cost constraint in all regimes. The implication is that European welfare states face a straitened future, between increasing demands and constrained resources, which may lead public opinion support to dwindle further.},

	isbn = {9780199546701},
	abstract = {Throughout the world, governments are restructuring social and welfare provision to give a stronger role to opportunity, aspiration and individual responsibility, and to competition, markets and consumer choice. This approach centers on a logic of individual rational action: people are the best judges of what serves their own interests and government should give them as much freedom of choice as possible. The {UK} has gone further than any other major European country in reform and provides a useful object lesson.
This book analyses the pressures on social citizenship from changes in work and the family, political actors, and population ageing, and the processes within government in the relentless international process of globalization that have shaped the response. It examines the various social science approaches to agency and argues that the logic of rational action is able to explain how reciprocity arises and is sustained but offers a weak foundation for social inclusion and social trust. It will only sustain part of the welfare state. A detailed assessment of empirical evidence shows how the outcomes of the new policy framework correspond to its theoretical strengths and limitations. Reforms have achieved considerable success in delivering mass services efficiently. They are much less successful in redistributing to more vulnerable low income groups and in maintaining public trust in the structure of provision.
The risk is that mistrustful and disquieted voters may be unwilling to support high spending on health care, pensions and other benefits at a time when they are most needed. In short, the reform program was undertaken for excellent reasons in a difficult international context, but risks throwing the baby out with the bathwater.},

We use panel data from 1980–2002 to investigate the effects of population aging on both the program size and the benefit generosity of public pensions in 18 {OECD} countries. Population aging is accompanied by cutting smaller slices out of larger cakes: it increases aggregate spending on pensions but freezes or decreases the generosity of individual benefits. Controlling for political, institutional and time-period effects, we find that public pension efforts are significantly mediated by welfare regime type. Moreover, since the late 1980s pension effort has more fully adopted a retrenchment logic. It is the politics of fiscal and electoral straitjackets, not gerontocracy, which shape public pension spending today. While population aging is accelerating, contrary to alarmist political economy predictions democracies are not yet dominated by a new distributive politics of elderly power.},

Various indicators examined show that in terms of relative level of welfare expenditures, features of welfare institutions and social rights, there were significant differences between Western European countries in the first half of the 20th century, but diversity significantly decreased by the 1950s, and the tendency of convergence continued steadily in the next two decades. Subsequently, changes in variation between countries from the 1970s onwards displayed a somewhat less clear-cut pattern, but in several areas the convergence continued. As a result, in 1990 the differences between the Western European countries can be regarded as less significant in that respect than in the middle and especially at the beginning of the 20th century. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

The purchasing power of lone-person households on social assistance varies from about {US\$} 140 a month in the {US} to {US\$} 1,285 in Switzerland {(OECD,} Benefits and Wages, Indicators 2004). In many countries social assistance benefits are too low to lift household of working age out of poverty. In only 10 out of the 30 {OECD} countries net social assistance benefits exceed the poverty line (50\% of the median standardised net disposable income).
This doctoral research aims to provide insight into the decisive factors in the level of social assistance benefits. This study focuses on three theses in particular. First I examine whether differences in benefit amounts are linked to differences in the activation policy towards social assistance recipients. It is indeed widely supposed that countries with generous social assistance benefits avoid the trade-off between adequate benefit amounts and high labour market participation thanks to a tight activation of benefit recipients. Compulsory participation in activation programmes for recipients of unemployment and social assistance benefits and strict sanctioning of unwillingness to work are supposed to clear the way for generous social benefits. 
A second explanation for differences in social assistance levels is the institutional variation in social security systems. The social and political readiness to provide generous benefits for the poor would depend on the degree of middle class inclusion, this is the capacity of the social security system to respond to middle class needs for income security. The level of social assistance benefits is therefore supposed to correlate positively to the  universality and generosity of social insurance benefits. 
Finally, a significant amount of economic, sociological and political literature is available on the potential relationship between the government level at which redistribution is organized and welfare generosity.  I investigate the relationship between the generosity of social assistance schemes and several dimensions of decentralisation (the administration, decision-making and funding of social assistance schemes) at two levels of government (the substate and the local level). 
Each of the theoretical models above will be tested by means of fuzzy set analyses linking the social policy indicators of some twenty {OECD-countries} to several indicators of social assistance benefit levels.},

	abstract = {A recurrent critique on the welfare state is that it crowds out social capital (networks, trust and norms). However, the empirical evidence on the crowding out hypothesis is still scarce, findings are sometimes contradictory, and there is variation in the measurement of social capital. In this article we explore the crowding out hypothesis on the basis of data from the European Values Survey wave 1999/2000 for 23 European countries. Compared to (the few) other comparative studies on the hypothesis, our study contains more recent data and for a larger number of countries. Instead of focusing on a single dimension of social capital, we use an eight-scale measurement model of social capital; we explore the relationship between welfare (regime type, social spending) and social capital at both country and individual level, and we control for confounding factors. At the aggregate country level we found no evidence at all in favour of the hypothesis. At the individual level we found that it does matter for people's social capital in which type and size of welfare state they live. However, there is only evidence for a crowding out effect in case of people's trustworthiness. With regard to other forms of social capital, there is at best mixed evidence, but mostly our findings contradict the crowding out hypothesis altogether.},

given to two ambitious competing approaches: Mancur Olson’s theory of encompassing interests

reached by virtue of a superficial application of economic analogies, which abstracts away many
crucial characteristics of democratic politics, such as information imperfections, weak incentive
structures, and collective action failures. The basic explanation for efficient outcomes may
have more to do with the size of rulers’ stakes in the economy than with voluntary Coasean

first discuss some leading theoretical paradigms in the political sociol-
ogy of welfare states in advanced industrial democracies, such as
logic-of-industrialism, working-class-strength, pluralist and ‘new
politics’ perspectives. I argue that for different reasons, these perspec-
tives cannot satisfactorily account for post-communist pensions devel-
opments in Hungary and Poland between 1989 and 1996. Next I
review the argument that non-intentional or ‘non-political’ policymak-
ing was the cause of the pensioner booms. I indicate that this perspec-
tive is hard to square both with the early legislative efforts by the
Hungarian and Polish governments and parliaments and with the sub-
sequent numerical and financial growth of the pension systems. I con-
clude by briefly suggesting that further progress in understanding
these developments could be made by a greater focus on the strategic
motives and political benefits of the policies allowing hundreds of
thousands of working-age individuals to go on early and abnormal re-
tirement.},

Some observational studies have shown that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain, but intervention studies have shown mixed results. {OBJECTIVE:} Our objective was to assess the association between consumption of total meat, red meat, poultry, and processed meat and weight gain after 5 y of follow-up, on average, in the large European population who participated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and {Nutrition-Physical} Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home and Obesity {(EPIC-PANACEA)} project. {DESIGN:} A total of 103,455 men and 270,348 women aged 25-70 y were recruited between 1992 and 2000 in 10 European countries. Diet was assessed at baseline with the use of country-specific validated questionnaires. A dietary calibration study was conducted in a representative subsample of the cohort. Weight and height were measured at baseline and self-reported at follow-up in most centers. Associations between energy from meat (kcal/d) and annual weight change (g/y) were assessed with the use of linear mixed models, controlled for age, sex, total energy intake, physical activity, dietary patterns, and other potential confounders. {RESULTS:} Total meat consumption was positively associated with weight gain in men and women, in normal-weight and overweight subjects, and in smokers and nonsmokers. With adjustment for estimated energy intake, an increase in meat intake of 250 g/d (eg, one steak at approximately 450 kcal) would lead to a 2-kg higher weight gain after 5 y (95\% {CI:} 1.5, 2.7 kg). Positive associations were observed for red meat, poultry, and processed meat. {CONCLUSION:} Our results suggest that a decrease in meat consumption may improve weight management.},

While some argue that this awakening is refreshing and new and, in fact, long overdue, I demonstrate that spatially focused demographic theories and research agendas clearly predate contemporary interest in these topics. I assert that recent methodological advancements have merely encouraged and brought refinement to the expanding body of spatially oriented population research—research strongly rooted in demographic tradition and practice. Indeed, I make the claim that, until roughly the mid-20th century, virtually all demography in the United States (and elsewhere, but not specifically examined here) was spatial demography. Then, shortly after mid-century, a paradigm shift occurred, and the scientific study of population quickly came to be dominated by attention to the individual as the agent of demographic action. Traditional spatial demography—macro-demography—gave way to micro-demography, and, I argue, most demographers simply abandoned the data and approach of spatial demography. In closing the paper I include a brief discussion of the recent awakening that has come to spatial demographers from developments in other disciplines, principally geography, regional science, and spatial econometrics. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

This paper suggests that attempts to operationalise the consensual approach have been frustrated by their reliance on survey methodology.

Beginning from the framework of welfare state regimes in rich capitalist countries, this article radically redefines it and applies the new model to regions and countries which experience problematic states as well as imperfect markets. A broader, comparative typology of regimes (welfare state, informal security, insecurity) is proposed, which captures the essential relationships between social and cultural conditions, institutional performance, welfare outcomes, and path dependence. Using this model, different regions of the world {(East} Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and {sub-Saharan} Africa) are compared. For many poorer, partially capitalized societies, people's security relies informally upon various clientelist relationships. Formalizing rights to security via strategies for de-clientelization becomes a stepping stone to protecting people against the insecurity of markets.},

Everyone remembers a good teacher. But across the world, in developing country contexts, millions of children, seventy five million at the last estimate, have no access to schooling and no opportunity to engage with any teachers at all. And of the lucky ones in schools the chances of meeting a teacher to remember are dropping. In some parts of the world qualified teachers are a rarity with millions of untrained adults taking over the role of teacher.
Schools and teachers in many parts of the world face significant challenges. Enrolment is expanding to meet the millennium targets to have every child in school by 2015. Yet the supply of good quality teachers is falling behind. Not the least because the image of the teaching profession is deterring many from entering the profession. Poor status, low salaries and inadequate working conditions characterise perceptions of teachers in many countries. There are strong critiques of the one dimensional, didactic approach to pedagogic practice. Despite this, millions of teachers are carrying out, often heroically, the task of educating a newly enfranchised generation of learners.
This book focuses on the teacher role. It examines the problems of finding and retaining teachers and also on how these teachers can be supported, trained and educated. The book examines the ways in which teachers can help in raising achievement levels and contributing to poverty alleviation. The main argument of this book is that existing policy structures around teachers, whilst barely adequate in the twentieth century, are not adequate at all in the twenty-first. The book identifies the global pressures on teaching and shows how these are particularly acute in developing economies.
In summarising the key policy and research issues and analysing innovatory approaches to teacher supply, retention, training, education and career enhancement, the book provides a key text for policy makers, researchers and others working in this important development area.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The objective of this paper is to make a general comparison between urban-rural relationship in China and that in the developed countries aiming to draw some experiences based on which future tendencies of urban-rural relationship in China could be predicted.

Design/methodology/approach - The core analysis of this paper examines how the urban-rural relationship develops especially when urbanization rate reaches a very high level. Through literature review, this paper explores the evolution of urban-rural relationship in developed nations by looking at some international cities in different industrial stages. In parallel, it goes through this relationship in China after 1949 until now.

Findings - This paper shows that future urbanization development will be generated largely by rural-urban migration especially the eastern-inclined migration while rural industrialization-lead urbanization would develop at the provincial level. It points that education and training to the labor force is the crucial issue to future urbanization development in China.

Originality/value - The obvious value of this paper is to predict, through a historical review and comparison, urban-rural relationship in China of high urbanization level. Literature review finds some experiences in developed countries that would somehow take place in China. It also explores the eastern-oriented rural-urban migration and rural industrialization as well as their influence to urban-rural relationship.},

	abstract = {Present levels of income inequality in Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia remain considerably higher than their pre-transition levels, although the relative pace of change over time has varied quite a bit across countries. Using data from the 2006 European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions, this paper finds that prevailing levels of income inequality in these countries continue to be low by international standards, and that this is in large part due to the very high redistributive impact of direct taxes and public transfers. In addition to the instrumental role of tax and transfer policies in redistributing income, the paper highlights the important role played by differences in education levels and labor market participation rates in explaining observed inequalities across people and across different regions (although not in explaining observed differences across countries). The paper includes an analysis of key factors that help explain observed variation across countries in the level of public support for redistribution, including peoples' economic background and relative success in life, whether they perceive poverty to be associated with factors within or outside the control of those it afflicts (for example, laziness/lack of willpower vs. injustice in society).},

In Experiment 1, student subjects rated 13 causes of poverty on importance, the attribution of controllability, blame, affects of pity and anger, and judgments of help-giving (personal help and welfare). Two individual differences, conservatism and the belief in a just world, were also assessed. A principal components analysis categorized the causes into three types: individualistic, societal, and fatalistic. Conservatism correlated positively with a belief in the importance of individualistic causes, controllability, blame, and anger, and it correlated negatively with perceptions of the importance of societal causes, pity, and intentions to help. No systematic effects of the belief in a just world emerged. A structural equation analysis revealed that personal help is emotionally determined, whereas welfare judgments are directly related to attributions of responsibility and political ideology.

	abstract = {Attribution theory was used to relate causal explanations for poverty to affect and behavioral intentions. In Experiment 1, student subjects rated 13 causes of poverty on importance, the attribution of controllability, blame, affects of pity and anger, and judgments of help-giving (personal help and welfare). Two individual differences, conservatism and the belief in a just world, were also assessed. A principal components analysis categorized the causes into three types: individualistic, societal, and fatalistic. Conservatism correlated positively with a belief in the importance of individualistic causes, controllability, blame, and anger, and it correlated negatively with perceptions of the importance of societal causes, pity, and intentions to help. No systematic effects of the belief in a just world emerged. A structural equation analysis revealed that personal help is emotionally determined, whereas welfare judgments are directly related to attributions of responsibility and political ideology. Experiment 2 revealed a similar pattern of results using a nonstudent sample.},

	abstract = {One of Europe's old nations steeped in history, today Ukraine is an undisputed independent state. Ukraine's postcommunist transition has been one of the most protracted and socially costly, but it has taken the country to a desirable destination: It is a democracy and has transformed into a market economy with predominant private ownership. In this clear, accessible account of Ukraine's political and economic metamorphosis, noted expert on the postcommunist transformation Anders Aslund provides a chronological guide to the evolution of a country known for its diverse regions. Aslund identifies the protagonists and leaders who have formed the country's regimes and analyzes how constant governmental transitions have affected the achievement of a parliamentary-based system. The author presents an easy-to-read analysis that documents the country's transformation and assesses the ultimate repercussions of this gradual political rebirth on Ukraine's governmental and societal architecture.},
