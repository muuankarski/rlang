# Open Research Methods in general

The debate on open science in the context of Social and Humanitarian sciences has been predominantly focusing on open access to research publication and opening up the various types of digital research data (open research data). The use of open research methods has received a lot less attention due to obvious reason.

Firstly, research methods that researchers in humanitarian and social sciences have not being "software intensive" as is the case with digital humanities. Second, within the approaches that have used computational methods there has not been too many options to choose from and the use of proprietary analytical software like SPSS, Stata or SAS has been and still is common.

This was sensible choice in the era of closed data (@king2014)

Open research methods are referred as  of a wider open science discussion.
